   Unless I'm missing something, I think it would be handy to have a

   Also I noticed ctrl-d didn't delete the playlists, which could be
   my setup, I'm using Debian Unstable.

   Finally in addition to mulitple playlist delete, how about a total
   wipe of the ipod (with lots of 'are you sure?'s) thus making it
   ready for a new setup.

   HTH.

- be able to select multiple genres, albums, etc. at the same
  time. (should be possible -- difficulty is selecting several
  playlists)

I have the 20G model and I have more "f" directories
than gtkpod recognises. So gtkpod only fills up through f19, when
really I have through f29. Everything works fine on the iPod, it's
just that gtkpod refuses to put music into any of the other
directories.

- immediate copying of added tracks to the iPod (when reading tracks
  over a slow network they will still be in the buffer memory and
  won't have to read over the network twice if they are copied right
  away) (request by Seth Arnold)

- album support (normalize all tracks of an album with the same gain)
   for volume normalization

- gtkpod-like browse of file system contents

- upload text notes to iPod

- add more progress dialogues (in general!)

- add an option to let the user decide if all the gtkpod's
  playlist must be updated on export.

- on-the-fly resampling to a particular bit rate. I have 32 GB of
  songs be cause some of them at at 192, but I only need them at 128
  or so on the Ipod. Mus icmatch does this exact
  thing. (zumpicon@verizon.net) JCS: this could be done along with an
  arbitrary "conversion" on export: user provides a command line in
  the prefs dialogue that is executed instead of the simple copy
  command (should also support faac).

This would also include that gtkpod.in and gtkpod.out are called only
if not in offline mode. When switching from offline to online, mount
and gtkpod.in should be called. When switching from online to offline
gtkpod.out should be called. Further, the README file should be edited
to reflect the change.

Yes -- once they are removed, they are removed.

Could be done by checking against the "pending_deletion" list by md5 hash
before adding a new track.

- during a long operation (menues are blocked) the user can still edit
  the track data. This could potentially crash gtkpod -> need a way to
  block editing as well without blocking navigation.

- when deleting an entry in the last sort tab (of 2) sometimes gtkpod
  crashes

-----------------------------------------
Coverart (JCS):
Dragging tracks with coverart from Local to iPod may not work. It will
definitely not work for coverart embedded in the MP3 file.


Equalizer: (Julien Oster)
As you certainly have noticed, the internal iPod equalizer is causing 
ugly clipping (and thus horrible bass distortion) when using bass 
booster settings with a lot of MP3s. Googling around quickly revealed a 
forum posts (http://www5.head-fi.org/forums/showthread.php?t=84088) 
which suggests using mp3gain to lower the level of MP3s. That way, 
clipping no longer occurs. The forum thread also reports that doing so 
unfortunately also lowers the volume the MP3 is played, but that isn't 
necessarily the case.

I just spent some hours doing a lot of tests on MP3s with mp3gain and 
gtkpod and I finally came to a solution to avoid every clipping problems 
AND keeping the original volume in every case.

Before you say "but gtkpod already has support for mp3gain!", please 
read on. The mp3gain feature as it is implemented in gtkpod right now 
does not solve any equalizer bass distortion problems, it just 
normalizes the volume of all tracks. However, what I am suggesting here 
actually doesn't change the volume of the tracks at all, it just removes 
possible clipping and thus possible bass distortion.

While experimenting, dealing with all those different volumes, gains, 
soundcheck values, mp3gain settings and whatever else got me quite 
confused. I don't want you to get a headache, it's already enough that I 
got one ;-) So I'll show you step by step what you have to do to remove 
clipping from an MP3.

First of all, we need an MP3 to test the whole thing. Just choose an MP3 
which shows horrible and clearly hearable clipping distortion when using 
the "Bass Booster" equalizer setting on your iPod.

Let's assume that you have that track available as /tmp/foo.mp3 on your 
workstation. Uploading it without any change to your iPod and listening 
to it may be fine when the equalizer is disabled, but when choosing 
"Bass Booster" or another bass intensive setting, the levels of some of 
the lower frequencies are boosted beyond a limit so that that ugly 
distortion occurs. Not good.

We can easily solve this issue by using mp3gain on the track, giving the 
following output:

/tmp% mp3gain -r -o /tmp/foo.mp3
File    MP3 gain        dB gain Max Amplitude   Max global_gain Min
foo.mp3 -7      -10.690000      39675.560208    190     126

Note that the "-r" switch has to be there! Otherwise it doesn't work. 
I'm not entirely sure, but it looks like without the -r switch, only the 
volume information in the ID3 tag is changed while with -r, the relative 
volume of every single frame is changed (fortunately, also without 
reducing quality). To avoid clipping you have to volume the frames down.

As you know, the "-o" switch is just for a nicer output and doesn't 
affect how the file is handled.

Now, after doing this, you can already upload the file to your iPod 
using gtkpod. Looking at the soundcheck value after importing it shows 
that it isn't 0 anymore but something slightly off, like 0,3 or 0,75, 
however it's always close to 0.

Playing it reveals no clipping at all! You can try out every equalizer 
setting you want, mp3gain lowered the volume of the individual frames 
enough to not get any frequency boosted beyond any limit by the equalizer.

Happy now? No, there's still a problem: the distortion is gone, but the 
volume is way too low now. Of course, you can just increase the volume 
on your iPod, but sometimes even the highest volume actually seems a bit 
low (even on uncapped iPods). However, even that problem can be solved.

Let's look at the mp3gain output again:

File    MP3 gain        dB gain Max Amplitude   Max global_gain Min
foo.mp3 -7      -10.690000      39675.560208    190     126

So, it tells us the volume of every frame has been decreased by 10.69dB. 
If you would use mp3gain without the -r switch, -10.69 would be exactly 
the same value that would have got written in the "soundcheck" field.

But since we want to *increase* the playing volume to get the track back 
to its original volume, we do the opposite: we write "10.69dB" in the 
soundcheck field. Not as a negative value, but as a positive value!

Doing so, enabling "Sound Check" on the iPod and listening to the track 
again shows that the track volume is obviously back to original. But 
checking with the equalizer also proves... still no clipping!

Yay! So we have got rid of the clipping while still keeping the original 
volume and we're completely happy now.

Now, what do you think about implementing this functionality in gtkpod, 
similar to the already existing normalize functionality? That would 
really be great.

Of course, there's still one possible drawback, which depends on what 
you would like to have: using that method, nothing is actually 
normalized. The volume of the tracks is the same as before. But if my 
aching head isn't mistaken, skipping the "set the soundcheck field to 
the opposite value of the applied gain"-step will also result in 
normalization (also I still think the volume may be too low then, but I 
also think you could fix this by setting the Soundcheck field to a fixed 
value for all tracks).
