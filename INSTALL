How to compile/install gtkpod:

(For ubuntu/debian please refer to the end of this file for a quick round-up)

1. First, make sure you have compiled and installed the dependencies.
   Most Linux distros will include them, except maybe for libid3tag
   (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12349).

   Please do not confuse the libid3 library with the libid3tag
   library -- they are not related. libid3tag is part of the MAD
   project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mad/).

   Starting with version 0.96 gtkpod is using the gpod library.
   libgpod is available as a standard package for major
   Linux distributions. You can also install the library from source.
   Download instructions for the tarball or development snapshot can
   be found at http://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod.html

   The following packages are required for building gtkpod:

        autoconf (at least 2.55)
        flex (or lex)
        gettext
        glib
        gtk+ (gtk2 for the 2.0.x stream / gtk3 for the 2.1.0+ stream)
        libgpod (at least 0.6.1)
 				libgdl
				anjuta
        libid3tag (at least 0.15)
        libgnome-vfs-2.0 > 2.6 (for iPod autodetection under GNOME)

   Optional Packages

        For web browser plugin:
        webkitgtk (version 1 or 3 depending on version of gtk)

        For audio player plugin:
        gstreamer
        gstreamer-base
        gstreamer-plugins-base
        gstreamer-interfaces
        gstreamer-plugins (plugins to support mp3 / mp4 playback)
        gstreamer-pbutils

        For filetype conversion:
        flac
        libogg
        libvorbis
        lame
        faad2

        For opengl coverart display (clarity) plugin:
        clutter-gtk

        For download of coverart:
        libcurl

        For sjcd (sound-juicer) plugin:
        libgnome-media-profiles
        libbrasero-media3
        musicbrainz5

   The following can be used for installing the dependencies on ubuntu 11.10:

	      apt-get groupinstall Development\ Tools

				apt-get install \
				   libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev \
				   gstreamer0.10-plugins-base \
				   gstreamer0.10-plugins-good \
				   libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev \
				   libgstreamer0.10-dev \
				   gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse \
				   gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg \
				   gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad \
				   gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly \
				   libflac-dev \
				   libogg-dev \
				   libvorbis-dev \
				   libmp3lame-dev \
				   libclutter-gtk-1.0-dev \
				   libgpod-dev \
				   libanjuta-dev \
				   libgdl-3-dev \
				   libid3tag0-dev
				   faad \
				   libcurl3 \
					 libbrasero-media3-dev \
					 libmusicbrainz5-dev

   The following can be used for installing the dependencies on fedora 19:

        yum groupinstall Development\ Tools

        yum install \
            intltool \
            flex \
            gcc-c++ \
            webkitgtk3-devel \
            gstreamer1-devel \
            gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel \
            gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel \
            gstreamer1-plugins-good \
            flac-devel \
            libogg-devel \
            libvorbis-devel \
            libogg-devel \
            clutter-gtk-devel \
            libgpod-devel \
            anjuta-devel \
            libgdl-devel \
            libid3tag-devel \
            curl-devel \
						brasero-devel \
            libdiscid-devel \
            libgnome-media-profiles \
            iso-codes-devel \
            libmusicbrainz5-devel \
            libdiscid-devel

        # Enable rpmfusion
        yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm \
                                      http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

        # Add questionable media software!
        yum install lame lame-devel.i686 faad2

2. If you install libraries to /usr/local/lib please don't forget to
   add the path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH

     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
     PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

   You can add those lines to your ~/.bashrc or add it globally to
   /etc/profile.

   If you install packages from your Linux distribution, keep in mind
   that you will need to install the "-dev" packages as well to be
   able to compile.


3. Run the gtkpod 'configure' script to set up the compile

   ./configure

   The standard options to 'configure' apply.  For a list of options:

   ./configure --help


4. Compile the gtkpod software:

   make


5. Install the gtkpod software (may require root privileges):

   make install && ldconfig


   Note: You can test gtkpod without installing it. Some features
   (translation catalogues, icons, scripts) will be searched in the
   directories set by the configure script which may contain older
   versions or nothing at all:

   src/gtkpod



----------------------------------------------------------------------

** Note that you do not need to accept the default (usually
   /usr/local) install path when you compile and install the software.
   You may choose to install the software in a different location.
   For example, with libid3tag in a non-standard
   location, outside the $PATH and the usual build environment, you
   need to configure the build of gtkpod appropriately.  You need to
   set a CFLAGS variable during the 'configure' that sets the -I and
   -L flags correctly.

   As a practical example, let's say the libid3tag software
   was installed in $HOME/Applications/libid3tag, and you want to
   install gtkpod into $HOME/Applications/gtkpod.  Do this instead:

    CFLAGS="-I$HOME/Applications/libid3tag/include -L$HOME/Applications/libid3tag/lib" ./configure --prefix=$HOME/Applications/gtkpod ; make ; make install
