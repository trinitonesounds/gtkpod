*----------------------------------*


1) If your iPod is not mounted automatically when connecting it to
   your computer follow steps 1-7 in the "Connecting your iPod to a
   Linux box" (basically you need to get the iPod partition mounted to
   /mnt/ipod).  In most cases this should not be necessary any more
   these days.

2) If you are using GNOME, starting with V1.0 of gtkpod your iPod will
   be automatically loaded and displayed within gtkpod once you
   connect it to your box. Otherwise:

   - Use "Load iPods" to import the contents of your old iTunesDB (you
     may have to specify the correct mountpoint: right-button click on
     the "iPod" repository, select "Edit iPod's Properties" and change
     the mountpoint).

3) Use "Add Files", "Add Directories" or DND to add files or
   directories.

4) Use "Eject iPod" in the context menu or click on the icon to the
   left of the iPod name to write the added files to the iPod and
   create a new iTunesDB and unload the iPod from gtkpod.

5) Unmount your iPod. The easiest way is to use the windowmanager. If
   this is not an option for you continue with step 8-11 of the
   "Connecting your iPod to a Linux box" section (basically describing
   how to unmount and disconnect your iPod).

   You can automate the unmounting by adding creating a
   ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.eject file with the following line in it (without
   the quotation marks): "eject $1"

Tracks
-----

- You can add individual tracks, entire directories recursively, or
  existing playlists using "Add Files". A file selection dialogue will
  appear. By default existing tracks (same full filename) will be skipped.
- You can add directories recursively using "Add Dirs". A directory
  selection dialogue will appear.
- You can add existing playlists using "Add Playlists"
- You can delete tracks by marking them and pressing the "Ctrl-d" . If
  you delete tracks from the master playlist (the topmost playlist,
  called "gtkpod" by default).  You can also delete tracks by selecting them,
  and using "Delete Track" in the Edit menu or from the context menu.
- You can update ID3 tags of selected tracks in gtkpod from the mp3
  file by pressing "Ctrl-u" or choose "Update track info from file" in
  the Edit menu or from the context menu.
- You can rename ID3 tags by editing the fields in gtkpod. You can
  change an entire group of ID3 tags by editing an entry in the sort
  tab (or mark several tracks and edit the first).
- You can specify which tags to display in the preferences window
- You can specify (in the prefs window) if the ID3 tags of the
  corresponding mp3 file(s) should also be updated


Filter Tabs
-----------

- The two notebooks above the track display are called "Filter Tabs"
- They allow you to filter which tracks to display
- If you edit an entry in the filter tab, the corresponding entry in all
  associated tracks will be updated as well. When writing the tags to
  disk as well, updating of a large number of tracks may take a while


Playlists
---------

- You can create playlists with "New Playlist" or pressing "Ctrl-n" in
  the playlist listview.
- You can also create playlists by adding an existing playlist file
  with "Add file" or "Add playlist".
- You can add tracks to playlists by marking the tracks you want to add,
  and then dragging them onto the playlist.
- You can rename playlists.
- You can delete playlists by selecting the desired playlist and pressing
  "Ctrl-D", or by selecting "Delete Playlist" from the Edit menu.


Drag and Drop
-------------

Drag and Drop can be used in several ways:

1) gtkpod internal

- Playlists, entries of a filter tab, and tracks can be dragged.

- A drop _onto_ an existing playlist will add the tracks to that
  playlist

- A drop _between_ two existing playlists or behind the last playlist
  will create a new playlist to which the tracks are added.

- The default action for the drop is either move or copy as appears
  appropriate (e.g. playlists are moved within a database ('local' or
  'iPod/Shuffle'), but copied when dragged across different
  databases).  The applicable action is displayed within the drag
  icon and can be changed by pressing the control key during the drop. 

2) between external file browser and gtkpod

- Tracks, directories or playlist files can be dropped onto the
  playlist view or track view. Drops between two existing playlists
  create a new playlist.


Preferences File
----------------

On startup gtkpod will read the preferences from ~/.gtkpod/prefs (or
/etc/gtkpod/prefs if the former doesn't exist).


Startup and Shutdown Scripts
----------------------------

After reading the preferences file gtkpod will try to execute
~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.in (or /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.in if the former doesn't
exist) during startup.

Just before exiting the program, gtkpod will try to execute
~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.out (or /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.out if the former doesn't
exist).

Please see the section "Sick of loading the sbp2 modules by hand?" for
an example of how to use this functionality.



Load iPod and eject iPod scripts
--------------------------------

Before loading the contents of an iPod, gtkpod will call
~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.load with the iPod's mountpoint as the only
command line argument. Put any commands here needed to access the
iPod, for example if you need to mount the iPod manually.

When ejecting an iPod, gtkpod will call ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.eject
with the the iPod's mountpoint as the only command line argument. Put
any commands here you want to execute after gtkpod has written the
changes to the iPod. One major candidate will probably be 

sudo eject $1

gtkpod will not attempt to do any magic of it's own to
mount/unmount/eject the iPod.



Duplicate Detection
-------------------

You can instruct gtkpod (in the prefs window) to use
file-size-dependent SHA1 checksums to prevent the same file from
being copied to your iPod twice.

If a duplicate is detected, gtkpod will print out the the filenames
of the duplicate files. If the filename of the already existing file
is not available (it is not stored in the iTunes database, see
"Extended Information File" below), other available information of
the track is printed.


Extended Information File
-------------------------

Some (I believe) essential information is not stored in Apple's iTunes
database. You can therefore instruct gtkpod to write an additional
file (iTunesDB.ext) with extended information. For each track it stores

  - SHA1 hash
  - filename in the locale's encoding
  - filename in UTF8 encoding
  - hostname where the file was added (not used for anything yet)
  - filename of an associated converted file (for example an .mp3 for
    a .flac file)
  - if the file is present in the local database a reference to there
    in order for playcounts to work on the local database as well
  - last modification time
  - the charset used for the file when adding it

Since the extended information file is only valid with the
corresponding standard iTunes database, a checksum of the iTunes
database is also stored in the extended information file.

Using an extended information file will considerably speed up the
import of an existing iTunes database when using duplicate detection,
since the SHA1 checksums do not have to be re-calculated.

Using an extended information file will also allow modification of ID3
tags in the track files after the initial import, because the full
filenames are still available.


Refresh (Update) Track Info From File
------------------------------------

If you have changed the ID3 tags of your original file, you can update
the ID3 tags stored in gtkpod without removing and re-adding the
track. Simply select the track to be updated and press "Ctrl-u" or
choose "Update Track Info From File" from the Edit menu. Since gtkpod
needs to know the filename of the track, the "Extended Information
File" (see above) is needed.

"Update" will also re-read the replay-gain tags from disk, if
available, and set the soundcheck field. If no replay-gain tag is
available, the soundcheck field will be erased.

You can also select entries in the filter tab or entire playlists for
refresh.


Synchronize with Directories
----------------------------

If you have added files to directories or changed files in directories
you have previously added tracks from, you can use the "Synchronize
Dirs" utility to update your iTunesDB.

"Synchronize with Dir(s)" will use the selected tracks to make a list
of directories to update, so you should activate the "Write Extended
Information" option in the export section of the preferences dialogue.

It will then add all non-existing tracks in those directories and
update (see "Refresh") all existing tracks. The tracks are also added to
the currently selected playlist, if they aren't already a member.

Tracks that have been removed from the directory will only be removed
from the iTunesDB if this option is checked in the option dialogue.

For best results you should also activate duplicate detection. This
avoids unnecessary copying of unchanged tracks.



Volume Normalization
--------------------

There are two fields in the iTunesDB that allow to adjust the volume
of an individual track: the volume field (a signed integer) and the
soundcheck field (in dB). The volume is always active, whereas the
soundcheck field is only active when you select 'soundcheck' on the
iPod. Further, the soundcheck field only affects the earphone output
but not the line output of the iPod.

gtkpod will set the soundcheck according to the replay-gain tag set in
your mp3 file. Newer versions of 'lame' automatically include the
replay-gain tag when encoding. In that case the soundcheck field will
be filled in when you first import a track.

If no replay-gain tag is set, you can use the function 'Normalize
Volume' to call mp3gain (mp3gain.sourceforge.net) to calculate the
gain and write a replay-gain tag. Since this procedure is very time
consuming, it is not done automatically during import. You need to
install mp3gain in the default path or set the full path in the
'Tools' section of the preferences dialog. If the iPod is connected,
the tag is written to the file stored on the iPod.

At this time "album gain" functionality is not supported. "Album gain"
means that the volume of all tracks of one album is adjusted by the
same gain, such that the relative volume level remains the same. It is
planned to realize this in one of the next versions.

Also, please be aware that tracks are not normalized on a 'per
playlist' fashion. If a track is normalized, it's normalized in all
playlists it is a member of.

Once the replay-gain tag has been read, it is stored in the extended
information file 'iTunesDB.ext'. When you call 'Normalize volume'
again, the stored value will be used to re-populate the soundcheck
field. Use 'Update Track' to re-read the tag from the file.


Podcasts
--------

You have to download podcasts using a third party tool like bashpodder
(http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/) or gpodder
(http://perli.net/projekte/gpodder/)

Podcasts should be added directly into the 'Podcasts' playlist of the
iPod repository, for example by selecting the Podcasts playlist before
manually adding files/directories. Podcasts will then appear only in
the Podcasts section on the iPod.

If you add podcasts to the main playlist 'gtkpod/iPod' or any other
iPod playlist first and then drag them over to the Podcasts playlist,
the podcasts will appear in the Podcasts section on the iPod, as well
as in the normal music section.

The podcast 'repository' is a local repository (like 'Local') where
you can keep all local podcasts. No mechanism exists to automatically
synchronize the iPod repository with the Podcast repository at this
time. You have to drag the podcasts over manually.


Export of Tracks (Copy from iPod)
---------------------------------

- mark the tracks you want to export and select "Export Tracks from
  Database" from the file menu (or use the context sensitive menu)
- A file selection dialog window appears and you can choose the directory
  you'd like the selected files to be written to.
- You can specify the output filename in the prefs dialog by
  specifying a template (e.g. "%A/%a - %t"). You can specify multiple
  templates for different file formats by separating them by a
  semicolon (e.g. "%A/%a - %t.mp3;%t.wav"). See the tooltip in the
  prefs dialog for a list of identifiers.


Encoding of ID3 tags (charsets)
-------------------------------
If you use correctly written unicode ID3V2 tags you don't have to
worry about the charset setting.

Otherwise you must specify the charset to be used for representing ID3
tags in the preferences menu. The default is "System Charset", which
is the charset associated with the locale gtkpod is running under. If
your tags are stored in a different encoding, you should set it
appropriately.

Please note that if necessary you can change the charset each time you
add files or directories: the iTunesDB itself is using UTF16, so once
tags are imported correctly, changing the charset has no influence.

If you chose "Japanese (automatic detection)", gtkpod will try to
determine if the string is in ISO-2022-JP, Shift_JIS, or EUC-JP
(Hankaku Katakana (1-byte Katakana) may not be recognized correctly --
specify the correct encoding if you run into this problem). The actual
encoding used for the ID tags will be stored and will be used when
writing tags or doing updates/syncs. Check the "Use selected charset
also when updating or syncing tracks" and "Use selected charset when
writing tags" options if you want to specify a particular character
set when writing or updating/syncing. The default charset is "EUC-JP"
-- it will be used when the charset cannot be autodetected, as well as
when writing tags if a specific charset could not be determined
before.

gtkpod will recognize ID3V2 tags encoded in unicode automatically and
ignore your charset setting when necessary.


Extracting tag information from the filename
--------------------------------------------
Tags can also be extracted from the filename if you activate the
option 'Use this template to parse filename for tag information' and
supply a template that explains how the filenames are constructed.

For filenames like 
    music/new/latin1/alan_jackson - drive/01 drive_for_daddy_gene.mp3
you could use
    %a - %A/%T %*.mp3

to extract artist, album, track number and title.

The following character sequences are supported:

    %t: title
    %a: artist
    %A: album
    %c: composer
    %t: title
    %g: genre
    %T: track number
    %C: CD number
    %*: placeholder, ignore data
    %%: the character '%'

You cannot supply a template like "%a%t.mp3" because gtkpod would not
know how to separate artist and title. "%a_%t.mp3" would be correct,
if artist and title are separated by an underscore.

You can also omit the trailing ".mp3" if you want the template to
apply to all files instead of only to mp3 files.


Checking iPod's Files
---------------------
For whatever reason -- it may happen that tracks are present in your
iTunesDB that are no longer present on the iPod (dangling tracks), or
that tracks are on the iPod but not in the iTunesDB (orphaned
tracks).

The function "Checking iPod's Files" under the "File" menu will
identify both types and take the following actions:

Orphaned tracks:
A new playlist "[Orphaned]" will be created with all orphaned tracks
in it. The only exception are orphaned tracks that would become
duplicates (if duplicate detection is activated). Those are marked for
deletion with the next sync.

Dangling tracks:
These tracks will be marked for deletion with the next sync unless the
original PC file is still available. In that case you can have them
restored with the next sync.


Restoring your iPod after file system error
-------------------------------------------
If iPod's file system gets corrupted and you need to reformat your
iPod, there is a way to restore the contents semi-automatically if you
have been using the "write extended information file" (iTunesDB.ext)
options:

 - If the directory structure on the iPod doesn't exist yet,
   load the iPod in gtkpod and have it created for you. Then unload
   the iPod again.

 - copy your backup files in .gtkpod/ (usually iTunesDB and
   iTunesDB.ext) to your iPod (usually
   <mountpoint>/iPod_Control/iTunes/
   On the iPod the files must be named iTunesDB and iTunesDB.ext.

 - load the iPod in gtkpod

 - select the iPod repository and start "Check iPod's files" from the
   File menu

 - unload the iPod (or save changes)

This should restore your iPod to what it was before, provided you
didn't move or remove any of the original tracks on your harddrive, and
the charset information was stored correctly.


Playcounts & Rating
-------------------

Whenever you play a track completely on the iPod (firmware version 1.3
or higher) a counter in the "Play Counts" file will be increased by
one. The same file also contains the rating you can set with the 3rd
generation iPods.

This file appears to be deleted whenever the iPod resets itself --
e.g. because you disconnect it from the computer. Therefore, be
careful... Charging the iPod seems to do no harm.

When gtkpod is started, it will also read this file and incorporate
the information into the iTunesDB that can be written back to the
iPod.

There have been several requests to also register playcounts when
playing a track on the local machine. This is possible by calling
gtkpod as "gtkpod -p <filename>".

If gtkpod is already running, the playcount of that track there will
be increased by one. If gtkpod is not already running, the playcount
will be registered in ~/.gtkpod/offline_playcount. This file will be
read the next time you import the iTunesDB from your iPod, and the
playcounts will be updated accordingly.

Please note that if you start several instances of gtkpod, only the
first instance will register playcounts through "gtkpod -p".

Now all you have to do is tell your favorite player to call gtkpod
with the filename of the played track.

For xmms this is possible as of July 18th, 2004 (CVS
version). Versions before that (including 1.2.10) only allow you to
have an external program called at the beginning of a track. Our patch
allows to have an external program called also at the end of a track.

In each case you will need to activate the "General Plugin" called
"song_change" and configure it to call 'gtkpod -p "%f"'.


About filenames (excerpt from the GTK2 release notes):
------------------------------------------------------
* The assumption of GLib and GTK+ by default is that filenames on the
  filesystem are encoded in UTF-8 rather than the encoding of the locale;
  The GTK+ developers consider that having filenames whose interpretation
  depends on the current locale is fundamentally a bad idea.

  If you have filenames encoded in the encoding of your locale, then
  you may want to set the G_BROKEN_FILENAMES environment variable:
  
   G_BROKEN_FILENAMES=1
   export G_BROKEN_FILENAMES

  Best integration of GTK+-2.0 with the environment is achieved by 
  using a UTF-8 locale.

------ end of excerpt

It is my feeling that many people use filenames encoded in the
encoding of the locale. The "Add directories" dialogue already takes
care of this and assumes the filenames to be in the same encoding as
you have specified for the ID3 tags (see above). You can therefore
forget about the excerpt above.

However, the "Add Files" and "Add Playlists" dialogue (at the moment)
uses the standard GTK+-2.0 file selection dialogue. Therefore I have
no access on the conversion functions used, and a warning is printed
when filenames are encountered that are encoded in an encoding other
than the one of the current locale. ID3 tags are still read correctly
(according to the charset set in the preference dialogue).

*--------------------------------------------------*

The following environment variables can be set if needed:

IPOD_MOUNTPOINT: Defines the mountpoint of the iPod. This overwrites
the value stored in the prefs, but is overwritten by the command line
argument "-m" or "--mountpoint".

GTKPOD_DF_COMMAND: Only used on systems without statvfs(). Defines the
"df" command to be used for probing the free space on the iPod
including command line arguments. Default is "df -k -P". On some
systems it may be necessary to remove the "-P" option. The mount point
is added to this command line automatically. You can switch off calls
to df by setting this environment variable to an empty string.

This describes how to set up the iPod together with the automounter in
kernel V2.6.6 (some minor changes in the kernel configuration may be
necessary for older V2.6 versions).

1) It appears to be possible to use HFS-formatted (Apple)
   iPods. However, this short guide assumes you have a Windows
   (VFAT) iPod. For conversion from HFS to VFAT please see 

   http://www.blinkenlights.ch/gnupod/gnupod.html#SEC6

2) I'm using the following kernel configuration options (I'm only
   using FireWire -- so the USB options are just educated
   guesses. Please let me know if it works).

   I'm not using modules, simply because what's compiled in can't fail
   loading.

    * General Setup  -> Support for hot-pluggable devices - y
    * Device Drivers -> SCSI device support - y
    *                -> SCSI device support -> SCSI disk support - y
    *                -> SCSI device support -> SCSI generic support - y
For FireWire:
    *                -> IEEE1394 (FireWire) support - y

    *                            -> NLS ISO 8859-1 (CONFIG_NLS_ISO8859_1) 



(for iPods formatted with the HFS filesystem choose
    * Filesystems -> Miscellaneous filesystems
			   -> Apple Extended HFS filesystem support)

At least for the new 4Gs and iPod minis you should _disable_
(CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION, see Troubleshooting for more information):
    * File Systems -> Partition Types -> Advanced Partition Selection
		   -> EFI GUID Partition support

3) You need to install the following external packages:

   hotplug and udev (http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/)
   autofs (ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/daemons/autofs)

   Most likely packages are available for your distribution.

4) Write rules for udev (/etc/udev/udev.rules, add at the beginning)
   to recognize your iPod automatically (mind the spaces within
   "iPod...", and be aware that some distributions require a double
   equal after the BUS keyword (BUS=="scsi"...)):

BUS="scsi", SYSFS{model}="iPod            ", KERNEL="sd?2", NAME="%k", SYMLINK="ipod"

   This will map /dev/sd?2 to /dev/ipod everytime you plug in your
   iPod. That even works if you own more than one USB/Firewire device
   that shows up as a harddisk, independent of the order in which you
   connect the devices.

   (You need to replace "sd?2" with "sd?1" (or maybe just "sd?") for
   HFS formatted iPods.)

   For more information on how to write udev rules please refer to
   http://www.gamingclones.com/Howtos/udevrules.html. That document
   gives an easy-to-understand introduction

5) Set up autofs to automatically mount the iPod when you access it
   and unmount it after 2 seconds of inactivity. In /etc/auto.master
   add:

/var/autofs/removable   /etc/auto.removable     --timeout=2,sync,nodev,nosuid,gid=autofs,umask=007

   Adjust the gid,umask (and uid) values to whatever you need -- in this
   example all users in the group "autofs" have read/write access, and
   I have added all users that may access the iPod to the autofs group.

   In /etc/auto.removable add

ipod            -fstype=vfat            :/dev/ipod

   (Obviously you need to change the filesystem type from 'vfat' to
   'hfsplus' when you use an HFS formatted iPod.)

   Then simply add a link from /mnt/ipod:

   ln -s /var/autofs/removable/ipod /mnt/ipod


Now your system is configured to mount the iPod every time you access
/mnt/ipod and to unmount it again after two seconds of inactivity. You
won't have to worry about doing mounting/unmouting yourself any more.

|                                                  |
*--------------------------------------------------*

1) You need a Windows iPod. See e.g.

http://www.blinkenlights.ch/gnupod/gnupod.html#SEC6

for information about how to convert your mac iPod to a windows iPod.

Alternatively, I have received a report that Alan Cox's patches
(2.4.21-rc8-ac1, but 2.4.21-ac1 should work as well) include hfsplus
support. That should allow you to use hfs formatted iPods. But beware:
hfsplus support is still beta.

2) Get kernel source and configure
Needed configuration:

    * Code maturity level options - y
    * SCSI support - y
    * SCSI disk support - y
    * IEEE1394 (FireWire)/IEEE 1394 (FireWire) support (Experimental) - y
    * OHCI-1394 support - y
    * SBP-2 support - m (important to use module -- if someone finds
      out how to use hotplug with sbp2 compiled in, let me know)
      (With 2.6.1 compiling sbp2 in seems to work fine.)
At least for the new 4Gs and iPod minis you should _disable_
(CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION, see Troubleshooting for more information):
    * File Systems -> Partition Types -> Advanced Partition Selection
		   -> EFI GUID Partition support
    *              -> Native Language Support
    *                            -> Codepage 437 (CONFIG_NLS_CODEPAGE_437)
    *                            -> NLS ISO 8859-1 (CONFIG_NLS_ISO8859_1) 


3) Create /mnt/ipod:

   mkdir /mnt/ipod

4) Add a line to /etc/fstab. You should edit uid to match your user
   id. Also, /dev/sda2 may not be appropriate, if you have other scsi
   devices.

/dev/sda2	/mnt/ipod	vfat rw,user,noauto,noatime,errors=remount 0 0

   (For HFS this line should read

/dev/sda  /mnt/ipod  hfsplus  rw,user,noauto,exec  0  0

    please note that it's just '/dev/sda')


NOTE: Some users have had problems with newer versions of mount(newer than
mount-2.11h) The following fstab entry might work better for you.

/dev/sda2	/mnt/ipod	vfat rw,user,noauto,noatime,shortname=winnt 0 0

5) Install the hotplug utilities
   (http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/, debian package: 'hotplug')

   (If you don't want to use the hotplug utilities, you must call the
   rescan-scsi-bus.sh (see below) by hand after loading the sbp2
   module. This is different from 2.4.20.)

5a) Add the ieee1394 hotplug support (described at
    http://www.linux1394.org/faq.html#hotplug):

   - copy ieee1394.agent to /etc/hotplug/ from
     http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/linux-hotplug/admin/etc/hotplug/
   - mkdir /etc/hotplug/ieee1394
   - create /etc/hotplug/ieee1394/sbp2:
       #!/bin/bash
       if [ "${ACTION}" = "add" ]; then
	 . /etc/hotplug/ieee1394/rescan-scsi-bus.sh
       else
	 . /etc/hotplug/ieee1394/rescan-scsi-bus.sh -r
       fi
   - chmod +rx /etc/hotplug/ieee1394/sbp2
   - copy rescan-scsi-bus.sh to /etc/hotplug/ieee1394 from
     http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/rescan-scsi-bus.sh
   - just to be sure: restart hotplug:
	/etc/init.d/hotplug restart

6) Connect your iPod to your computer and wait until you see something
   like the following on your system log (you can use the 'dmesg'
   command to check).

7) Mount the iPod hard drive

   mount /mnt/ipod

8) do whatever you need to do (e.g. start gtkpod, see below)

9) Unmount the iPod:

    umount /mnt/ipod

10) Unload the module sbp2 (as most likely as root):

    rmmod sbp2

11) Disconnect the iPod from your computer (ignore the "Do not
    disconnect" message -- as long as you wait for the 'unmount' to
    command to finish properly, everything should be fine).

I don't have much information about this so far (I don't own a third
generation iPod). Please help me to fill in the gaps.

Stephen Drye sent me the following note:

"I've figured out how to get a USB-connected iPod recognized...:

The trick to it is that you have to 

- plug the iPod in

- it'll fail to be recognized by the SCSI subsystem

- now, even though your ipod says not to, unplug the USB cord and
  immediately plug it back in.

- since the iPod's hdd was already spun up, the SCSI subsystem now
  recognizes it and mounts it as /dev/sda

- You can then mount /dev/sda2 to /mnt/ipod as normal."

On the other hand: with my 4G iPod under 2.6.9 and 2.6.10 I never had
any problem whatsoever getting the iPod to work. With IEEE it was
awful (would work some times, would not some other time).

Sick of loading the sbp2 modules by hand every time you want to use your
ipod?  Are you sick of mounting it too?  Using sudo gtkpod can make manually
interacting with the ipod filesystem a thing of the past.  Note that you
should have your ipod working with gtkpod before attempting this automated
method, see the README that came with gtkpod in order to get things up and
running.

Here's a brief example of how I'm using gtkpod now in 8 easy steps.

(Remark: the hotplug facility of new kernels can also load and unload
the sbp2 module for you.)

/**********/
 * Step 1 *
/**********/
Using sudo allow users to load/remove the sbp2 module
Example /etc/sudoers
------------------------------- Begin Here ---------------------------------

# Cmnd alias specification
Cmnd_Alias IPOD=/sbin/modprobe sbp2 sbp2_force_inquiry_hack=1, /sbin/rmmod sbp2
# User privilege specification
atmos   ALL=(ALL) ALL
atmos   ALL= NOPASSWD : IPOD

------------------------------- End Here -----------------------------------
I use the force inquiry hack cause I have an older iPod, if you normally can
get by with /sbin/modprobe sbp2 then ignore the inquiry hack stuff.  Note
that explicitly specifying which module to probe/remove keeps the user from
being able to add/remove arbitrary modules.  This allows us to keep gtkpod
as a user process, and execute commands the user wouldn't usually have
enough rights to.

/**********/
 * Step 2 *
/**********/
Add a line similar to the below to your /etc/fstab, this will enable users
to mount the ipod with read/write capabilities.  Example line assumes your
ipod mount point is /mnt/ipod and your ipod is detected as /dev/sda

------------------------------- Begin Here ---------------------------------
/dev/sda2       /mnt/ipod       vfat    rw,user,noauto          0       0
------------------------------- End Here -----------------------------------


/**********/
 * Step 3 *
/**********/
Then setup your /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.in file to load the module when gtkpod is
started.
Example /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.in
------------------------------- Begin Here ---------------------------------

sudo /sbin/modprobe sbp2 sbp2_force_inquiry_hack=1

------------------------------- End Here -----------------------------------

/**********/
 * Step 4 *
/**********/

Then setup your /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.out file to unload the module when gtkpod
is exited.
Example /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.out
------------------------------- Begin Here ---------------------------------

sudo /sbin/rmmod sbp2 

------------------------------- End Here -----------------------------------

/**********/
 * Step 5 *
/**********/
Then enable ipod automounting in the gtkpod prefs(in the misc tab).

/**********/
 * Step 6 *
/**********/
You're now ready to use gtkpod in a much nicer fashion.  Start by
plugging in your ipod.  You should get a check mark with "OK to disconnect"
displayed on your ipod.

/**********/
 * Step 7 *
/**********/
Start gtkpod, your ipod should be accessible(i.e. autoimport should work)
A "Do Not Disconnect" message is displayed on your ipod while gtkpod is
running.

/**********/
 * Step 8 *
/**********/
After you exit gtkpod, the "OK to disconnect" message should be displayed
again.  It's ok to unplug your ipod now.  

Good Luck.

*----------------------------------*


- Display of large number of tracks is awfully slow (mainly because of
  the use of the standard GTK2 tree views) -> deactivate "Automatically
  select "All" in first filter tab" and/or deactivate "Automatically
  select master playlist". You could also "block the display" to speed
  up the display update. Further, decreasing the window size
  considerably speeds up the display.

  I also want to point out that updating the info window takes up a
  considerable amount of time. Update may become more intelligent in
  the future -- until then close the info window for more speed.

- When changing selections in the filter tabs while importing the
  iTunesDB, sometimes the interface freezes. I tried to track this
  problem down but only found out that gtk+ does not return control
  back to gtkpod. Selecting the "All" filter tabs seems to unfreeze the
  interface again.
