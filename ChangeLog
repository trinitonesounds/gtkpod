phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-12-12

    Fix for display of progress while converting tracks
    
    * When converting tracks on writing itdb, the progress bar must be reset
      to the number of tracks to be transferred. Otherwise, no progress and lots
      of warning messages on the cmd line.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-12-09

    Fix for restoring functionality of track normalization
    
    * Ensure that internal soundcheck functions populate a GError rather than
      displaying a warning dialog. The latter does not work well inside threads!
    
    * Save up all error messages until the end of the normalization run
    
    * Use the platform progress bar rather than bringing up a custom dialog
    
    * Provide the action for normalizing a playlist to the playlist plugins menus.

      confined to same case.

      clarity.
    
    * Makes it easier to make the treeviews multi selectable.
    
    * All functionality of original sort tabs maintained - possibly a few bugs...
    
    FS#34 - Select more then one entity in track selection

    * BROKEN_GTK_TREE_SORT is no longer necessary since required gtk version is
      for gtk 3.0+

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-11-05

    Fix for cogl errors generated by clarity plugin
    
    * Bug evident in clarity when plugin window is loaded but initially
      obscured by other plugin windows. Making the window visible generates
      cogl texture errors as the window is not completely realised by the time
      the load texture functions are called.
    
    * All signal callbacks now check whether the window has been realized before
      trying to go any further.
    
    * Realized signal callback added to ensure that when the window is made
      visible, the current playlist is loaded.
    
    * g_idle_add functions used to slow down the initialisation of cogl textures
      until the window has been fully realized.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-11-05

    * Preference values try to be set before the widget sources are properly
      setup.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-10-30

    Avoid possibility of symlinks causing infinite loops
    
    * Possibility that when recursing directories, adding tracks, symlinks can
      cause an inifinite loop leaving application unusable.
    
    * Remedies this possibility by logging the directories processed and
      handling the targets of symlinks appropriately.
    
    * Fixes 2561965 - Infinite loop while adding folders with symlinks

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-10-26

    Provide sensible sorting for adding files and directories
    
    * Tracks have been historically added in an arbitrary way. This attempts
      to address this by sorting the filenames before adding the tracks.
    
    * Would be better to sort the tracks after they have been added but
      catching all the added tracks is not easy so this makes a satisfactory
      middle option.
    
    * Addresses Debian bug #547295

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-10-16

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-10-15

    Fix the track display sorting functionality
    
    * plugin.c
     * The tm_autostore preference has to be set in order to modify the
       playlists on the ipod. Ensure this is set to TRUE by default if
       not set.
    
    * display_tracks.c
     * tm_rows_reordered was being called when the sort order signal
       callback was tripped. However, this signal is fired BEFORE the
       new sort order has been set so instead calling tm_rows_ordered
       as an idle process ensures the signal has completed first and the
       model updated.
     * The sort order is correctly updated and reflected in the ipod
       playlist.
    
    * track_display_preferences.c
     * Adds a checkbox to the track display preferences so that the
       tm_autostore preference can be switched on and off.
    
    Fixes task #83 - Carry sort order through to tracks on ipod

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-10-15

    Add multi-playlist support to context menu delete actions
    
    * playlist_display_context_menu.c
     * When multiple playlists are selected, allow the delete actions
       to delete all of them.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-10-03

    Allow the multiple selection of playlists in the playlist view
    
    * Only the first selection is passed to libgtkpod and notified to
      other plugins.
    
    * On selection of extra playlists, a reduced context menu can be
      displayed, allowing for actions to be performed on the set of
      playlists, notably deletion.
    
    Fixes:3413192 - Not obvious how to delete a playlist without selecting from

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-09-25

    Fix for fail message when initialising an ipod
    
    * See bug #3411223 for details
    
    * Rather than simply setting the entry of the set_model combo boxes,
      find the actual model row containing the model string and set that
      as the active iter. Ensures that if the user goes with what has
      already been pre-loaded then this is in fact the active iter.
    
    * Seems that initing an ipod in libgpod does not set the model in the
      sysinfo file so just set it here - maybe a patch to libgpod
    
    * Initing an ipod should also attempt to create an extended info file.
      Ensures that the "No-extended" file error does not appear anymore.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-09-18

    Conditional inclusion of DISABLE_DEPRECATED flags
    
    * Including DISABLE_DEPRECATED flags consistently can cause problems when
      including library includes from other projects that are still using
      deprecated functions.
    
    * To avoid this, use DISABLE_DEPRECATED flags in development and unstable
      releases but avoid using them in actual releases.
    
    * See FS#84 at http://gtkpod.org/bugs/index.php

    Better still always check for clutter
    
    * Since more plugins will probably use clutter, check for it regardless but
      only allow clarity if it is installed.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-09-11

    Sort out clarity's options for building or not building

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-09-11

    Implement drag n drop cover support for clarity
    
    * In the same way as the coverart display, using fetchcover, a jpg can be
      dragged from the browser and replace the main cover in the index.
    
    * The dnd sends a track update signal and the tracks are all updated
      accordingly.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-09-11

    Tidy up some function and variables
    
    * clarity_utils.*
     * Since these functions are being called externally then rename them to
       the full namespace.
     * Refactor the process of signalling a track update to a single function
       so it can be reused.
    
    * clarity_canvas.c
     * Change the _set_loading_complete function to the clearer
       clarity_canvas_block_change
     * Rename all references of ccanvas / cc to self since this is the file we
       are in.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-09-10

    Implement the updating of a track in clarity
    
    * If a track has been changed, clarity should react and if necessary update
      the artwork cover accordingly. This may mean changing the artwork, text
      or moving the track completely to a new album item.
    
    * AlbumItem
     * data reference no longer necessary
    
    * clarity_canvas
     * Formally defines the FLOOR constant better to understand the location
       set or each cover
    
    * Support for shift + mouse-button-1 to select the tracks referenced by the
      cover art.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-09-04

    Support for updating clarity when a track is modified
    
    * When a track has its meta-data changed then this should update the display
      according to the correct affect of the change, eg. no effect is unrelated
      to the album key, move the track to a new album etc..
    
    * album_model.*
     * remove_track function should not need to refind the relevant album item
       when in fact it has already been found and could be passed in as a parameter
     * it is not an error for the _get_index function to fail to find a key so
       return -1 in an if condition rather than using g_return...
     * search_for_track function simply iterates through all album items in an
       attempt to find the given track. Long winded and slow but necessary if a
       track has sufficiently changed to make looking it up in the index impossible
    
    * claritiy_canvas.c
     * Need to ensure that like the remove function, the covers are refreshed.
       The animate function provides this perfectly.
    
    * clarity_widget.c
     * Separate out _add and _remove functions as both used by respective callbacks
       and by the track_updated callback.
     * Given we already know the album item in _remove function it is unnecessary
       to find it again so pass it in as a parameter.
     * Completion of track_updated callback.

    * Wrong logic on the conditions for setting the default values of the sort
      preferences.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-09-02

    Support for track removal in Clarity
    
    * Handle the updating of clarity display when a track is removed from the
      current playlist. Essentially removes the cover if the last track and
      removes it from the album model.
    
    * gp_itdb.c
     * Seems we are signalling track removal twice unnecessarily
    
    * clarity_canvas.c
     * Most of the initialisation of covers is only done for the visible ones.
       Not setting the position causes other covers to lie below the original
       visible covers and looks odd. Set the position of all covers.

    Ensure tracks are sorted before selecting
    
    * Highlighting the displayed tracks in clarity plugin selects the first
      track in the list rather than the first track according to the sort
      preference.
    
    * Sort the tracks first before selecting the first track.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-08-31

    Support for clarity detecting track additions
    
    * album_model.*
     * Changes to API adding functions for getting the index of an album item
       given an album item or track.
     * Include the album item index in the album_model_foreach function,
       avoiding the need to the canvas to refind the index which is a potential
       bottle neck.
    
    * clarity_canvas
     * Remove the threading as serves little purpose.
     * Modifications supporting canvas add album item function
    
    * clarity_widget
     * callback for track added completed

    Add a reference to current playlist to clarity widget
    
    * Makes the widget less dependent on making calls to gtkpod_*
    
    * Once we have the playlist, it is important to keep it updated by

    * clarity_canvas.*

    Cover art display fixes for colors and updating
    
    * cover_display_preferences.c
     * display_coverart has transitioned to GdkRGBA while the preference dialog
       has not, producing some odd colours for the foreground text colour.
    
    * display_coverart.c
     * coverart_display_update never actually redrawing the cover display so
       a call to redraw is required.
     * no need to include a separate one in the sort function as a consequence
     * typo in coverart_get_foreground_display_color

      crash.

      append the error to the error page and force the display of the log
      window.

      the error log screen.

     * The callback added one to a count for the track's itdb.
     * When the count reaches the threshold, the itdb is saved.
     * This is a single point of saving and will always be fired upon track
       addition regardless of how the track was added, eg. by directory, playlist

      no longer necessary

    * Filetype plugins updated to populate the GError.

    m4a plugin not initialising mp4 library handle

      using mp4_init to get a handle to the mp4v2 dynamic library
    
    * also ensure the handle is disposed when deactivating plugin

    * With more than one iPod, it is annoying to click load iPods only to find
      that all iPods try to be loaded rather than just the selected one.
    
    * Load iPod toolbar button modified to have a drop down that includes a
      "load selected ipod" menuitem as well as the "load all ipods".
    
    * Default of the button is still to load all ipods as most users will have

    This reverts commit 63c1dab53811675bf084d1b9194987d35b204c53.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-03-05

    Small fixes to coverart display
    
    * cover_display.xml
     * update_policy changed to discontinuous which will only update the cover
       display once the user releases the drag of the slider
    
    * display_coverart.c
     * redraw on changing the sort order
     * fix the slider value when select_cover is called as inaccurate by the
       4 nulls prepended to the album_key_list

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-03-02

    Auto generate ChangeLog. Update news
    
    * Enters quick paragraph in NEWS
    
    * generate-ChangeLog.sh
     * Auto generate the ChangeLog file from the git log
     * hooked into make dist to auto-gen when creating dist tarballs

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-03-02

    Clear up error message dialogs that occur during itdb import
    
    * Plethora of error messages that can pop up when importing an itdb.
      Instead of displaying them all in dialogs or in the status bar, gather
      them all up and display one dialog at the end of the operation

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-28

    Allow different names for gtkpod directory
    
    * Releases and betas can have the version number appended to the root gtkpod
      directory. This breaks the code for setting local versions of the config
      directories.
    
    * Replaces straight string equality testing with regular expression partern
      matching to allow for names such as gtkpod-2.0.0

Javier Kohen <jkohen@users.sourceforge.net>	2011-02-28

    Don't track count of saved files anymore.

Javier Kohen <jkohen@users.sourceforge.net>	2011-02-28

    Add a separate GtkAdjustment for the save threshold spin button.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-27

    Reverse commit that loaded embedded artwork
    
    * This function is far too slow for importing artwork from ipods and actually
      completely pointless since ipods get their artwork from the artwork db
      rather than reading it from the tracks.
    
    * The bug for not reloading embedded artwork for local itdbs will become an
      issue again but requires greater work for resolution.
    
    * gp_itdb.c
     * autodetection of ipods should only occur after all itdbs have been loaded
       and all plugins initialised.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-26

    COPYING and AUTHORS not being symlinked
    
    * Shortcuts for files not being created for dev purposes

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-26

    Update po files from transifex.net
    
    * Added the latest changes gleaned from transifex.net
    
    * Added new language files for Czech, Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-26

    Update of po files using make update-po

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-22

    Fix embedded artwork not being loaded
    
    * Embedded artwork is initially detected and displayed. However, on quitting
      and restarting the artwork is no longer displayed.
    
    * Embedded artwork is only read by the individual filetypes, specifically
      mp3. This file info is never read on startup of the application.
    
    * file_itunesdb.c
     * Add an extra clause to get the track info using the filetypes.
    
    * file.[ch]
     * Make the get_track_info_from_file function available
    
    * gp_init.[ch]
    * gtkpod.c
     * In order to use get_track_info_from_file at startup, all the plugins
       have to be loaded BEFORE it gets called.
     * gp_init is responsible for importing all the itdbs so this needs to be
       split so that all the important bits n pieces are initialised but the
       itbbs are loaded later.
     * gp_init_itdbs is called after all the plugins have been loaded so all
       the itdbs are still fully initialised by the time the gui is displayed

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-21

    Migrate gtkpod.glade to gtkbuilder
    
    * gtkpod.glade renamed to core-gtkpod.xml
    
    * Removes all remaining active uses of GladeXML from the codebase including
      GladeXML functions

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-21

     * HOWTO is redundant and no longer applicable

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-21

    Move spl_window from core glade to display playlist plugin
    
    * spl_window only used by display_playlist actions so should be in that
      plugin.
    
    * gp_spl.[ch]
     * spl_window related functions only used by spl_window
    
    * misc_playlist[ch]
     * add_new_pl_or_spl_user_name only used by display_playlists plugin

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-21

    Migrate photo editor glade to gtkbuilder

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-21

    Migrate repository editor glade to gtkbuilder

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-21

    Fix for crash when deleting a repository
    
    * Freeing the dead itdbs too early creates a segfault in the playlist and
      repository combobox images.
    
    * Re init the comboboxes then free the dead itdbs

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-20

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-17

    Migrate track display glade to gtkbuilder

Javier Kohen <jkohen@users.sourceforge.net>	2011-02-16

    Changed auto-save gating to use time based intervals.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-15

    Memory leak fixes
    
    * misc_playlist.c
     * msg not being displayed to user and not being freed
    
    * mp4file.c
     * free netitle and title
    
    * Thanks for Daniel Forsi for spotting leaks

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-15

    Made some improvements to exporter plugin
    
    * Thanks to Chris Jenkins for finding the bug, initial debugging and patch
    
    * misc.[ch]
     * get_string_from_template now has GError as parameter to capture errors
    
    * file_export.c
     * Both export to filesystem and playlist now have an idle callback so that
       the file choosers can be closed before displaying any error windows
     * Filechooser removed from fcd struct as a consequence and replaced with a
       filename string instead.
     * GString for errors added to fcd to store errors messages as the export is
       proceeding. This replaces warning dialog that keep popping up for each
       track error / failure.
     * All errors reported at end of export run in confirmation dialog
     * Progress bar widgets replaced with anjuta framework progress bar
    
    * gp_private.[ch]
     * Constructs for gtkpod specific errors

Javier Kohen <jkohen@users.sourceforge.net>	2011-02-15

    Removed symlinks hard-coded to one contributor's local file system (they're recreated by make).

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-13

    Stop race condition between conversions and save
    
    * file_itunesdb.c
     * Changing the meaning of to_convert_num meant that the transfer loop is
       being exited too quickly hence tracks have not yet received their ipod
       path and this causes a crash when trying to save the track in the shuffle
       database.
     * Fix is to get the transfer loop to wait on the converting_num var as well

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-13

    Migrates sorttab filtering from glade to gtkbuilder

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-13

    Replace details editor glade file with gtkbuilder xml

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-13

    Fix how coverart display shows details editor
    
    * cover_display_context_menu
     * display_track_artwork and edit_track_details were dependant on
       gtkpod_selected_tracks which is not appropriate.
     * Modify menu actions to use cover MAIN_IMG
    
    * display_coverart
     * Change printf to g_warning

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-12

    Stop the details editor from enable undo button
    
    * Arbitrary reasons why navigating tracks in details editor leads to
      the undo buttons being enabled and the editor thinking something has been
      changed.
    
    * misc_conversion.c
     * Slightly odd formatting means wrong value being returned in get_time()
    
    * misc_track.c
     * Inaccuracies converting text into numbers means check for sameness are
       not good enough. So changed around to convert original number to text
       and hence compare text with text
    
    * details.c
     * Disable the lyrics text view if the read_lyrics functions return an
       error string

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-11

    Create preference for file save threshold
    
    * A hardcoded "10 tracks to save after" has been modified to a preference
    
    * Possible for user to change it up to 100.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-10

    Convert cover display glade file to gtkbuilder xml

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-10

    Minor fixes while playing with coverart display
    
    * file.c
     * Avoid displaying g_return fail error if path cannot be found when trying
       to read lyrics
    
    * details.c
     * Seems the g_threads_enter / exit are causing deadlocks. Removed for the
       moment

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-09

    Replacement of coverweb.glade with coverweb.xml in po configuration
    
    * Not currently updated po files.

     * Modify to use new framework functions

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-07

    Tidy up m4a filetype plugin enablement
    
    * configure.ac
     * m4a plugin enablement depends on both mp4 library and faad

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-02-06

    Tidy up and fix the converter
    
    * Fixes perceived deadlock when saving files that need converting.
      Conversion scheduler being killed by a return value of FALSE. My mistake!!
    
    * file_convert.c
     * Collect up all lock/unlock calls into 2 functions so easier to debug
     * When trying the mutex in converter_scheduler, avoid returning FALSE since
       this kills the timeout function, which in turn leaves the saving in an
       infinite loop as the converted tracks cannot be moved into the finished
       list.
    
    * file_itunesdb.c
     * Improve the status messages
    
    * core_prefs.c
    * gtkpod.glade
     * Get the conversion log to display if converting
    
    * playlist_display_action.c
    * file.c
     * Improve the incremental saving routines when adding files

    * configure.ac
     * Fix typo.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-30

    Fix some conversion issues
    
    * configure.ac
    * *m4a/Makefile.am
     * Check for faad dependency, warn if not installed
     * Only if faad installed is m4a file type plugin available
    
    * prefs
     * Fix the preferences path_conv_* in order to work more sanely.
     * mp3, m4a and mp4 paths are maintained and other checks made to determine
       whether files will be converted by them or not.
    
    * scripts/*
     * Improve logging so that a consistent log file is generated in the
       conversion cache
    
    * file_itunesdb.c
     * Ensure that extra status messages are still displayed while progress
       is ongoing.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-30

    Make plugins.mk more portable
    
    * Use LN_S macro
    
    * Link to all *.xml files in data directory to avoid forgetting special
      files to do with toolbars etc...

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-30

    Make some corrections to fr.po header
    
    * Seems that some bits n pieces that come down from transiflex are not
      quite compatible with build processes

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-28

    Revert "Committed version of gtkpod.pot"
    
    This reverts commit 90252f372ab6b3474626dd65a6e5bd5e8eed7cd6.
    
    * transifex seems to struggle with connecting to the url of the
      gtkpod.pot so revert back to previous.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-28

    Committed version of gtkpod.pot
    
    * Although this is a generated file, it can be used by
      transifex.net for translations and if this file is changed will
update the transifex files automatically.           
    
    * If this proves useful then leave under source control. Otherwise
      revert to ignoring it.

    Fixes for French translation and mp4file.c
    
    * Migrated from gtkpod 1.0.0 patch provided by Eric Lassange with thanks

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-28

    Update Italian translation

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-28

    String fixes
    
    * libgtkpod/misc_track.c
     * Make string similar to other singular strings.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-26

    Fix some configure warnings and missing files
    
    * configure.ac
     * Seems that config.h.in no longer gets recreated. Rejigged some of the
       configure macros and now all files should be properly created from
       scratch
    
    * plugins.mk
     * Modify the %.plugin operation to remove GNU specific syntax so stopping
       annoying warnings when running configure
     * build-plugin-file takes care of generating the .plugin files
    
    * */Makefile.am
     * Each plugin calls build-plugin-file to generate the .plugin file

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-25

    Run libtoolize to ensure creation of ltmain.sh
    
    * Only with this macro in the configure.ac file will libtoolize run and
      ltmain.sh being created

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-24

    Add some progress to deleting tracks
    
    * misc_track.c
     * Change text from 'deleted' to 'deleting' since tracks have not been
       deleted yet!
     * Surround actual deletion with ticks to the status progress bar to
       indicate what is currently happening

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-24

    Adding / Removing files and progress
    
    * file.c
    * playlist_display_actions.c
     * Improve the ability to save files as addition goes along rather than
       trying to do a great save at the end. With a large number of files at
       least only the last 9 would be lost with a hang/crash rather than all
       of them.
    
    * file_itunesdb.c
     * Remove the progress dialog for saving and replace with existing anjuta
       progress framework.
    
    * gtkpod_app_iface.*
    * anjuta-app.c
     * Framework functions for accessing anjuta progress bar.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-23

    Remove superfluous functions
    
    * fileselection.c
     * Left over and copied elsewhere
    
    * repository_editor.c
     * Only thing that uses functions so seems appropriate to move them out
       to plugin.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-18

    Fix for potential segfaults due to '%' in message strings
    
    * Should hopefully stop any messages containing a % symbol such as that used
      in urls for apostrophes (%27) from crashing the application

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-14

    Build fixes
    
    * plugins/plugins.mk
     * The *.plugin files must be installed (else the plugin manager
       finds them only when running gtkpod from sources), but this
       breaks make distcheck again and fixing doesn't require to force
       the creation of symlinks.
       Add .PHONY targets.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-13

    Fix logging in conversion scripts
    
    * convert-2mp4.sh
     * Move first log line as stupidly in the wrong place
    
    * convert-2m4a.sh
    * convert-2mp3.sh
     * Add logging to these scripts

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-12

    Build fixes
    
    * plugins/plugins.mk
     * Force creation of symlink to avoid failure during make check.

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-12

    Build fixes
    
    * Makefile.am
    * data/Makefile.am
     * Generate AUTHORS and COPYING symlinks in the directory that contains
       them and exclude them from make dist.

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-11

    Build fixes
    
    * plugins/*/Makefile.am
     * The *.plugin.in files need to be unconditionally added else
       translations would break (because they are referenced in
       POTFILES.in) if make distcheck is executed on a system lacking
       some prerequisites or if --disable-plugin-* is used.
       Change also the other makefiles for consistency.

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-11

    Build fixes
    
    * libgtkpod/file.h
    * libgtkpod/gp_spl.h
     * Do not add path when including files that are in the same directory
       to fix make distcheck and for consistency with other files.
    
    * plugins/plugins.mk
     * Plugins need to find includes in libgtkpod directory during VPATH
       builds and make distcheck.

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-11

    Build fixes
    
    * plugins/*/Makefile.am
     * Exclude *.plugin files from make dist because now they are built
       from the corresponding *.plugin.in files.

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-07

    Translation fixes
    
    * plugins/*/*.plugin
     * Rename to plugins/*/*.plugin.in and mark for translation the Name
       and Description fields.
    
    * plugins/*/Makefile.am
     * Use plugins/plugins.mk in the remaining makefiles.
    
    * po/POTFILES.in
     * Add plugins/*/*.plugin.in. Remove plugins/coverweb/coverweb.glade.h
       since now it is automatically created and deleted during update-po.
    
    * .gitignore
     * Ignore generated .plugin files.
    
    * POTFILES.skip
     * Add data/glade/coverweb.glade because it is a symlink.
    
    * POTFILES.in
    * POTFILES.skip
     * Replace *.xml.h with *.xml
    
    * data/glade/Makefile.am
     * Now gtkpod.glade is handled automatically via POTFILES.in.

    * plugins/details_editor/details_editor.glade
     * Make the "File Size" not editable.
    
    * plugins/sorttab_display/display_sorttabs.c
     * Make the calendar windows stay on top of the main window.

    Seems coverweb now contains translations
    
    * build translation scripts require coverweb glade to be included

    Remove m4_defn as it breaks intltool-update
    
    * configure.ac
     * Seems that including any brackets in the version of AC_INIT, eg. using
       an m4_defn causes intltool-update to fail. However, removing the
       m4_defn does not seem harm anything.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-04

    Remove surplus include in fetchcover

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-04

    Alternate version numbering technique using m4
    
    * configure.ac
     * Move version number script out of AC_INIT macro so it uses a static var
    
    * version.m4
     * Use this to establish dynamic version number. Should be run before
       AC_INIT and should be hopefully compatible with autoconf 2.66+

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2011-01-02

    Translation fixes
    
    * plugins/cover_display/display_coverart.c

    Update translation files after gui modifications

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-02

    Remove browse label in favour of "..."s in normalization window
    
    * In line with other plugin guis

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-02

    Fix repository plugin to use filechoosers as much as possible
    
    * Remove browse buttons and text entries in favour of file choosers
    
    * Only in cases of sync commands have text entries been left to allow for
      inclusion of additional command arguments

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-02

    Add coverweb.glade soft link to skipped files

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-02

    Fixes to stop crashes if syncronising directories is switched on
    
    * gtkpod_app_iface.c
     * If name is null, stop any lookups occurring in the hash table
    
    * file.c
     * If there is no dot in the path / filename then return a null type since
       it cannot be identified, rather than blindly adding 1 to the pointer and
       risking an array out of bounds sigsev

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-01

    Repository info view
    
    * infoview.c
     * Some more sensible destroying of widgets
    
    * plugin.c
     * Better label for 'open' menu item

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-01

    Remove ogg and flac preferences
    
    * Pointless conversion preferences since the only reason to add files of one
      of these formats is to add them to an ipod so need to be converted
    
    * prefs.c
     * preferences no longer need to be set
    
    * core_prefs.*
     * preference checkboxes removed since ability to convert them depends on
       addition of appropriate file type plugin and they must be converted to
       be useful

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2011-01-01

    Remove 'show toolbar' menu item
    
    * anjuta-actions.h

    Update Italian translation

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2010-12-31

    Translation fixes
    
    * po/POTFILES.in
     * Use intltool-update --maintain to add missing files (list is
       sorted now).
    
    * po/POTFILES.skip
     * Remove deleted files and add .xml files for which intltool-extract
       creates .h files.
    
    * plugins/playlist_display/plugin.c
     * Use _() instead of N_() to make the translation appear.

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2010-12-30

    String fixes
    
    * data/glade/gtkpod.glade
    * plugins/core_preferences/core_prefs.xml
     * Do not mark empty properties as translatable (they will be set with
       prefs value at runtime or with user input).
    
    * libgtkpod/file_convert.c
     * Make "programming error" messages more similar to the majority of
       such messages and do not translate them.
    
    * src/anjuta-app.c
     * Fix typo.
    
    * plugins/sorttab_display/sorttab_display.glade
     * Do no make filler label translatable (it should probably be replaced
       with a GtkAlignment widget).
    
    * plugins/filetype_ogg/filetype_ogg.plugin
    * plugins/filetype_ogg/oggfile.c
     * Replace "ogg" with "Ogg" as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-29

    Fix toolbar being lost when scrolling playlist view
    
    * Playlist display scrollbar originally located outside both toolbar and
      playlist treeview. So, when scrolliing the toolbar is scrolled out of
      sight.
    
    * Takes scrolled window lower in hierarchy so only surrounds treeview. Thus
      when treeview becomes over-populated for size, only it will be scrollable
      rather than the whole widget

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-29

    Another attempt at 'handling' %27 in ipod mountpoints
    
    * Use g_uri_unescape_string for display of mountpoint in warning messages.
      Should convert %27 and other characters back to puntuaction marks

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2010-12-29

    String fixes
    
    * data/glade/gtkpod.glade
    * plugins/exporter/exporter.xml
     * Do not mark empty properties as translatable (the will be set with
       translated strings at runtime or with user input).
    
    * plugins/exporter/exporter.xml
     * Do not end labels with a full stop. Update for changes in
       Preferences window.
    
    * plugins/repository_editor/plugin.c
     * Do not use the same accelerator for items in the same menu.
    
    * plugins/info_display/info_display.plugin
     * Change "ipod" to "iPod" in plugin description.
    
    * plugins/exporter/file_export.c
     * Fix string.

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2010-12-24

    GUI fixes
    
    * plugins/cover_display/cover_display.glade
     * Open the artwork preview window centered on the main window and
       with a border.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-28

    Attempted fix for segfault due to escape string in uri
    
    * autodetection.c
     * Would appear that ipod names that include an apostrophe, eg. Kyle's ipod,
       have a problem being escaped to uri type strings, ie. 's changed
       to %27s. Printing this string in warning messages segfaults gtkpod
       since it is considered a format string.
     * Using the non-uri string for all print statements should avoid this
       rather specific problem.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-28

    Update configure system
    
    * configure.*
     * Use autoupdate to replace deprecated m4 macros
     * Rename configure.in to configure.ac

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-24

    * core_prefs.c
     * Reformat source file in line with other source files
     * Instead of destroying the dialogs, hide them so that they can be reopened
    
    * core_prefs.xml
     * Destroy the dialog when the parent preference notebook is destroyed
     * Connect gtk_widget_hide_on_delete to delete event of each dialog so that
       clicking the cross on the dialog hides it rather than destroys it.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-24

    Fix transient dialogs opening with incorrect parent
    
    * misc.*
     * Implement extra version of get_user_string that doesn't assume gtkpod_app
       as the parent of dialogs.
    
    * coverweb_preferences.c
     * Specify correct parent of bookmarks dialog
    
    * track_display_preferences.c

    * Update translation strings

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-22

    Tighten up name when creating new playlist
    
    * misc_playlist.c
     * If name is blank then return
     * If playlist with name already exists then return
    
    * Update *.po files with new strings and latest updates

Daniele Forsi <daniele@forsi.it>	2010-12-20

    * filetype_mp4.plugin
     * Curse of the copy n paste!!
    
    * plugin.c
    * *.po
     * Fix translation constants to make them consistent

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-19

    Fix preservation of sorting preferences
    
    * misc.*
     * Include case sensitivity as a parameter in compare string functions
     * case sensitivity preference no longer assumed in guts of compare functions
     * case sensitivity no longer a general preference but different preferences
       allocated on plugin-by-plugin basis
    
    * cover_display
     * Add sorting radio buttons to preference window
     * Include callbacks for sorting and case sensitivity
     * sorting no longer based on st_sort preference but on unique coverart
       preference cad_sort
     * Try to reduce the number of redraws by blocking the signal hander on the
       slider bar
     * Move most of the redraw function calls to the external callbacks so that
       redrawing only occurs at the conclusion of the model changes. Not perfect
       but better than it was
    
    * playlist display
     * Add individual sort preference support using pm_sort and case sensitivity
       using pm_case_sensitive
    
    * sorttab display
     * Add individual sort preference support using st_sort and case sensitivity
       using st_case_sensitive
    
    * track display
     * support for case sensitivity using tm_case_sensitive

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-19

    Configuration fixes
    
    * configure.in
     * Improve conditionals on available library components so that filetype
       plugins are only compiled if dependencies are present
     * Check for gstreamer-interfaces as well as gstreamer since we use
       xoverlay for displaying videos
    
    * details.c
     * Fix deprecation for GtkNotebookPage
    
    * default.profile
     * Since ogg file type is optional then the plugin cannot be specified as
       mandatory
    
    * gp_private.h
     * Give anonymous enums names

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-19

    Minor fixes to preferences and m4a plugin
    
    * M4A Plugin
     * Copy n paste errors in M4A structures
    
    * anjuta-app.c
     * Insert space in front of Plugins title to ensure this category is always
       first in the icon category list in the preference dialog. Seems that
       activating a plugin refreshes all plugins hence the list rebuilds and
       the first in the list is re-selected.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-18

    Fix some missed translation strings
    
    * POTFILES.in
     * Add the anjuta-actions.h, which contains Quit and other actions

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-16

    Small fixes in playlist display and anjuta framework
    
    * anjuta-app.c
     * Reset dock layout action not working since layout.xml renamed to
       dock-layout.xml in gtkpod. Modifies this accordingly
    
    * playlist_display
     * Move create playlist sub-menu under music menu
     * Remove "menu" label from create playlist submenu as unnecessary
    
    * Thanks for Daniel Forsi for pointing these out!

    Details Editor fixes
    
    * Remove inner viewport / scrollbar from notebook since we have one on the

    * Sort out selection of page in notebook. Ensure the last page selected is
      stored in the preferenes

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-11

    Adds support for converting videos to ipod spec mp4s
    
    * video filetype uses generic convert-2mp4.sh script to convert videos to
      mp4s.
    
    * convert-2mp4.sh
      * Uses ffmpeg for the conversion
      * Adds tag information using ffmpeg's metadata options.
      * Log file added for debugging problems

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-11

    Add more debugging and add another file removal if conversion failed
    
    * file_convert.c
     * add some more debugging statements
     * if conversion failed but track is still valid then the track still
       needs to be removed and cleaned up

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-11

    Change annoying backup dialog box
    
    * If backup database is not found then a dialog is displayed indicating
      that a back database has been created. This is just annoying. Better to
      have a status bar message that still informs but does not get in the way

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-11

    Replace SCRIPTDIR constant with get_script_dir() function
    
    * Relies on scripts being installed in order for conversions to work while
      developing. Changes scripts directory to act in the same manner as images
      and data directories.
    
    * Relies on initialisation in directories.c

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-05

    Fix m3u playlists to support Windows carriage returns
    
    * Strange errors while importing music library, claiming some files
      did not exist.
    * m3u files were being picked up as well, and because these were made on
      a Windows system they contained Windows newlines.
    * Since the importer only strips off the \n, gtkpod was trying to open
      'filename.mp3\r'.
    
    * Thanks to Jop Zinkweg (jzinkweg@gmail.com) for the patch

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-12-05

    Fixes to update gui if convert goes wrong
    
    * file_convert.c
     * conversion_get_track_info does not need a conv since it is never called
       with one
     * Another attempt at sorting a deadlock with the conversion mutex
     * If a track fail to copy then ensure the gui knows to remove the failed
       track
    
    * gp_itdb.c
    * misc_track.c
     * Drag n drop adds the track to the given ipod before the conversion has a
       chance to fail. If conversion does fail before the thread runs, eg. no
       installed script then remove the track using the g_idle callback
     * gp_remove_track_cb callback for removing a track . Used with g_idle_add,
       it ensures that it runs on the correct thread.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-11-30

    Ensure the view titles are translateable
    
    * Insert uniform couple of spaces in front of each title so they have a
      small padding on the left side when shown in the view

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-11-30

    Convert info dialog into a view

    Minor filetype fixes and fix for a deadlock
    
    * gp_itdb.c
    * misc.c
     * Removal oversight of mp4file includes
    
    * Makefile.am
     * Add m4a filetype plugin to extra dist
    
    * file_convert.c
     * Make the conversion scheduler function try the mutex lock rather than
       blindly grabbing it. Since this function is called every 100ms then a
       later attempt will be made.
     * Missing unlock in conversion_convert_track causes deadlock.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-11-25

    Refactoring of filetype support into individual plugins
    
    * File types supported with use of describing plugin
    
    * Plugins determine the file type's capabilities
    
    * Removal of all switch statement code and replaced with filetype registry
    
    * Extensible architecture for adding new file types
    
    * Generic video file type at the moment for basic support of mov etc..

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-11-21

    Build system not recreating configure script
    
    * If configure script exists then autoconf does not bother to recreate it
      unless configure.in has been changed. Due to dynamic versioning against
      git, the version number is cached and incorrect.
    
    * Force autoconf to recreate all files, ensuring a correct build version.

    Correct mistakes in glib interface use
    
    * Seems the dummy object is the reference to pass around rather than the
      interface itself.
    
    * Creation of functions to act as getters for interface properties

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-11-06

    ui files no longer required
    
    * Most of these no longer apply since original glade files have
      been split out into the plugins. They are being migrated to
gtkbuilder xml files so these could be retrieved during that           
migration.

    Rework of configure script versioning - language fixes
    
    * configure.in
     * Seems the m4_defn macro does not play nicely with intltool-update script
       which is run when creating debs. Modified to use recognised mechanism
       of m4_esyscmd.
    
    * version.sh
     * version script that will ordinarily tack the commit id to the version no.
    
    * po/*
     * Fix missing and skipped files

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-11-02

    Modifications to configure script to tar long filenames
    
    * Running make dist on current project layout causes errors when trying to tar
      since the file path lenghts exceed 99 characters.
    * Switched to using tar-ustar option which allows 256 characters.
    * Updated AC_INIT to take the project and version number
    * Updated AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to take the tar option.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-10-28

    Breaking out mserv functions into own plugin
    
    * Created a separate plugin to incorporate the mserv functions lifted out
      of the core library
    
    * Removal of play and enqueue functions from tools since these are now
      handled by the media player plugin.

    Tidy up the context menus
    
    * Categorise and create sub menus where necessary
    
    * Replace play and enqueue with sub menu dedicated to execute any track
      commands that have been registered.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-10-17

    Sorttab display preference for sorting
    
    * Adds preference panel for changing the sort order to filter tabs
    
    * Removes randomize and alphabetize actions as sorting now controlled
      exclusively in the preference window.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-10-17

    Remove sort window from track display as no longer useful
    
    * Reworking of the sorting of tracks. Sorting now only occurs by clicking
      the headers of the track display.
    
    * Track preferences concened with ignore strings and which columns to display

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-10-17

    Add playlist display preferences
    
    * Foremost preference to sort the playlists alphabetically

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-10-13

    Set preference for show exec command popup menu
    
    * If more than one track exec command has been registered then a popup menu
      must be displayed. This can be avoided by setting a preference in the
      track display preferences.
    
    * gtkpod_app_iface.*
     * plumbing for executing a command identified in the
       DEFAULT_TRACK_COMMAND_PREFERENCE.
    
    * track_command_iface.h
     * TrackCommandInterface needs an id and display text
    
    * track_display.glade
    * track_display_preferences
     * preferred track command preference implementation

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-10-09

    New track exec command interface
    
    * track_command_iface.*
     * Plugins can register themselves with this interface to execute a function
       on the current selection of tracks
    
    * display_tracks.c
     * Tracks no longer directly editable. Maybe that edit plugin registers
       itself as a track exec command?
     * Track is double-clicked to execute a command. More than one comamand
       should display a menu of commands to execute. Menu is still TODO
    
    * media_player/plugin.c
     * First implementation of track command. Result is user double clicks a
       track and the track starts to play in the media player

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-10-09

    Reworking of media player plugin

    * playlist_display_actions.c
     * Need to signal other widgets that the selected playlist has been updated
       when adding tracks from file or directory.

    * gp_itdb.h
     * Aovid compile error in file_itunesdb,c

Christophe Fergeau <cfergeau@mandriva.com>	2010-09-29

    libgpod expects empty strings to be NULL
    
    gtkpod sets empty Itdb_Track strings to "" instead of NULL to make
    things less error-prone. However, this should stay internal to gtkpod,
    and as far as libgpod is concerned, empty fields should be NULL, not "".
    This commit makes sure that empty fields will be set to NULL before
    trying to write the iPod database.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-09-15

    Fixes some selection errors when removing tracks
    
    * gtkpod_app_iface.c
     * tracks being removed should be removed from selected and displayed
       tracks lists before notifying plugins that the track has been
 removed.           
    
    * media_player.c

    * display_coverart.c

    Stop warning about losing qualifiers from guchar* to gchar*

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-08-29

    Allow backward compatibility to gtk 2.18
    
    * gtk_widget_get_realized() only available from gtk 2.20. Since Mandriva
      2010 includes 2.18, not unreasonable that this version should still be
      supported.
    
    * configure.in
      Make the -DGSEAL_ENABLE flag conditional on a gsealed_gdk since use of
      GTK_WIDGET_REALIZED is not an option with gsealed.
    
    * Add pp version checks in code to allow for older gtk versions

Christophe Fergeau <cfergeau@mandriva.com>	2010-08-29

    don't try to free non-malloc'ed memory
    
    get_data_dir return a filename from gtkpod global state, we really
    don't want to free the returned string (was crashing here). Duplicate
    the string instead so that we can use the same code path as when
    g_build_filename is used.

    This reverts commit 421506c1097f76aa3ae4c6b0dfcbc0e792727d12.
    The exporter.xml file is available in plugins/exporter, and during
    build, a symlink will be created from this file to data/glade. If
    the file is already present, build fails.

    Translation files reverted to remove auto translation attempt
    
    * Translation files that have not have human edits were updated originally

      have been removed so at least the messages will be returned in English.

    Realisation that limitations of poedit preclude its use
    
     * Use of poedit to update from source files fails to detect the
       gtkpod.desktop.in file hence its values are obsoleted wrongly.
    
     * Seemingly random order of poedit's update means lack of consistency
       for order of strings in .po files

    * display_coverart.c
     * Should not rely on gtkpod_get_selected_tracks for its tracks as these
       may not have been set when coverart_update has been called. Besides the
       display should show all albums in a selected playlist.

    * playlist_display/plugin.c
     * Playlist display has no need to worry about tracks being removed since
       the view never displays tracks
    
    * display_playlists.c
     * pm_remove_track and pm_add_track simply notify other UI components so
       no longer necessary
    
    * file_itunesdb.c
    * display_photo.c
     * Re-implement photo database support

     * display_photo to become core of photo plugin

    Bug fix for erroneous lyric dialog message
    
    * bug 3021855
    
    * file.c
     * Instead of displaying gtkpod_warnings, tack the error onto the lyrics
       string array just like the other errors. Prepend them with the word
       Error so that the write_lyrics knows that they are not proper lyrics.

    Small fix in clean-local target in plugins.xml

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-07-03

    Fix bug where preferences are shutdown before plugins can write to them
    
    * sorttab display has a cleanup() function which is called on deactivate.
      However, gtkpod_shutdown is called prior to the plugin deactivation hence
      preferences are destroyed.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-07-03

    Remove dev hooks for data directory
    
    * ui, icon and glade files now loaded using local get_*_dirs() functions
      rather than relying on installing to /usr/local/data using sudo. Makes
      for a cleaner dev environment
    
    * symbolic links still created for ui and glade files but these only used
      for development and are never installed

       next time it is opened, the former has trouble displaying.
    
    * display_sorttabs.c
     * stop broadcasting the displayed tracks quite as often.

    Filter seems to not work properly when trying to filter tracks
    
    * The filter-as-type search bar does not seem to filter against tracks
      correctly, rendering most of the time a blank view.
    
    * misc.c
     * Proposed Changed is to modify utf8_strcasestr search function to defer
       to g_strrstr instead, which seems built into glib since its first
       development.

    Several enhancements to importing audiobooks, podcasts TV shows
    
    * Patches thanks to Joel Smith <jsf-lists.gtkpod@jk1.net>.
    
    * Main idea is that gtkpod should get the MP4 tags from MP4 files and
      populate the track fields with whatever data is present so that
      less manual setting of track details is required when importing
      files.
    
      * When importing MP4/M4V/M4A/M4P files, only set the media type
        on a track if not already set
    
      * Try to dlopen newest libmp4v2 first
    
      * Check MP3 genre flag to see if it's an audiobook or podcast.
        If the genre tag is set to audiobook or podcast, set the media
        type appropriately.
    
      * Support for UTF-16 chapter names in MP4 files
    
      * Read Apple-specific atoms from mp4 files using mp4v2 for TV
        Show data and media type
    
      * Read Apple-specific atoms from MP4 files using mp4v2 without
        MP4Tag functions for TV Show data and media type
    
      * When importing audiobooks or podcasts, default to remember
        playback position and skip when shuffling.
    
      * Changing media type in file details to audiobook or podcast sets
        the remember playback position and skip when shuffling flags.

    Cleanup and move to anjuta 2.28.2
    
    * configure.in
     - Seems that anjuta needs to be in the CFLAGS and LIBS vars.
     - Needed for anjuta-*.* in src directory
    
    * gtkpod.glade
     - Preferences window moved to its own preferences.ui files since
       the api for anjuta_preferences window has moved to GtkBuilder
    
    * Makefile.am
     - Housekeeping for linking to preferences.ui
    
    * anjuta-app.c
     - Updates to match the anjuta 2.28.2 source

    Repository editor - fixes
    
    - gtkpod_app_iface.*
      Use repository editor rather than the interface as the parameter
    
    - repository_editor.c
      On receiving an itdb update, ensure that the index of the repository
      combo box is found and the set it after re initiating the combo
      Have the editor respond to added and removed itdbs too

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-04-05

    Repository plugin near functional completion
    
    - Signals added for responding to an added itdb or removed itdb
    
    - Repository Editor interface created for handling the editing of
      repositories and also the initialising of them.
    
    - Repository Editor added to GtkpodAppInterface and used as the link
      from the main application.
    
    - Means the init dialogs are added to the repository plugin.
    
    - Repository Plugin:
      - repository.c used for common functions
      - creator, editor and init separates the different UI functionality

    Fix memory leak reported by valgrind.

phantomjinx <p.g.richardson@phantomjinx.co.uk>	2010-03-28

    Tidying up
    
    - Uncomment release/block widgets, gtkpod statusbar messages
    
    - repository.c
      - Add combo boxes to repwin struct so that they are global
      - Remove repwin from parameters of functions since there is now only one
        and it is global to the file
      - Add callbacks on playlist and itdb updates. Especially important when
        an itdb is replaced since the comboboxes hold references to all the
        itdbs.

    Converting the repository dialog into a view
    
    - gtkpod_app_iface.*
      display_widget function passes off to the anjuta implementation
    
    - anjuta-app.c
      display_widget checks if widget is a dock item and if so displays
      accordingly. Means that the dock widgets if closed can be redisplayed.
    
    - repository.c
      Redesign of repository view including removal of cancel and ok buttons

    - gtkpod_app_face.c
      Some parts of the code like to play around with the glist of tracks,
      including freeing it. Thus, important to provide a copy of it to avoid
      random sigsevs and crashes

    default.profile
      - Reversed plugins in profile as it seems they are processed in reverse
        order.
      - Playlist Display must be processed first since it is on the left and
        below the Sorttab Display
    
    gp_private.c
      - Error in placing these functions in gp_private.h
    
    Playlist Display
      - Given the plugin a title once again since it is used in the view menu
      - Given a minimum size to the playlist window

        for the development symbolic links
      - plugins refactored to include these functions in their makefiles
    
    playlist_display.png
      - remove pointless icon from plugin
    
    gtkpod.h
      - change gtkpod_xml_new to gtkpod_core_xml_new as plugins seem to like to
        use this version rather than the one in misc.h
      - gtkpod_core_xml_new hands off to gtkpod_xml_new in misc.h

    playlist l&f and signalling updates
    
    - Removes playlist-related png files from data directory and adds them to
      display_playlists data directory.
    
    - data/gtkpod.ui
      * Add place holder for gtkpod music menu related icons
    
    - gtkpod_app_iface.*
      * 2 signals created for notifying when a new playlist should be selected
        and when and itdb should be updated.
      * Implies that when the library programmatically wants to make a playlist
        be the current playlist then any interested plugins can be notified and
        can update themselves.
    
    - gtkpod_app-marshaller.*
      * new signals added to gtkpod interface so marshallers created for use with
        them.
      * these files are auto-generated from the .list file so no need to modify
    
    - stock_icons moved back to the library so its available to all plugins
    
    - file_export.*
      * only ever used by playlists_display so moved into that plugin
    
    - display_playlists.*
      * no longer maintains its own current itdb and playlist but gets them from
        the library, ie. plugin is the viewer whilst library is the model.
    
    - playlist_display.ui
      * Load iPod menu item and toolbar item properly implemented and working
    
    - display_itdb.c / gp_itdb.c
      * replace_itdb function reinstated and loads the given itdb correctly and
        then informs the UI by emitting a signal.

* src/display.c           
  src/display_tracks.c           
  data/gtkpod.glade:           
    
  Clean up statusbar display in main window (remove resize           
  grip when statusbar is not at the rightmost corner).           
    
  Work around a bug in GTK+ that puts the sensitive area of           
  the resize grip at the wrong position after a resize of the           
  window or hiding of the filter tab arrow by manually           
  updating the contents of the statusbar after a resize and           
  after hiding the arrow.           
    
  Changes to gtkpod.glade are small but diff is excessive even           
  if saving twice (V3.4.5).

    Add preferences for handling ReplayGain
    
    This adds two preference settings, replaygain_offset and
    replaygain_mode_album_priority.  The first is a simple offset value that
    is added to the ReplayGain value before being converted to a Soundcheck
    value and stored in the iTunesDB.  The other setting allows a choice
    between Audiofile (aka album) gain and Radio (aka track) gain.

    Read ReplayGain values from ID3 tags
    
    Support ReplayGain data in common ID3 tags.  The order of preference for
    ReplayGain data is now ID3, APE, and lastly the LAME tag.

Todd Zullinger <tmz@pobox.com>	2009-04-18

    Prefer Audiophile (Album) over Radio (Track) gain
    
    Also adjust the ordering of the tags checked.  We now check the APE tag
    first, because if a user has set it they likely would want to use that
    value instead of the one added automatically by Lame at encode time.
    Thanks to Tino Keitel for the patch.
    
    This also resets the GainData struct in mp3_get_track_ape_replaygain(),
    so that we don't end up using some mix of data from the LAME Tag and the
    APE tag for ReplayGain.

    !!! There are two possible sources for segfaults in

    - track_copy_artwork() writes the lyrics tag to the file and
    checks for duplicates. This might destroy the list we are just
    iterating over.
    
    - write_tags_to_file() writes tags to the file and checks for
    duplicates. This might destroy the list we are just iterating
    over.

    Visible scaled images are cached to improve performance. Only when
    they are no longer visible is the scaled version unreferenced. If the
    scaled version does not exist then a new scaled version is created as
    usual. Thus, when moving along the collection, only 1 image should
    be scaled when the drawing occurs rather than 9.

    * src/prefs_window.c
    
    Fixed potential memory leak in on_coverart_display_bg_color_set
    
    * data/gtkpod.glade
    * src/prefsdlg.c
    
    Support for change background colour added to new prefs dialog

    * data/cdshine.png
    * data/cdshine_main.png
    * data/Makefile.am
    
    Removed reflection shadowing as this is done programmatically.
    No higlighting required on main image to png removed entirely.
    
    * gtkpod.glade
    
    Added colour selection button for CoverArt Display background colour.
    
    * src/display_coverart.c
    * src/display_coverart.h
    * prefs_window.c
    * prefs.c
    
    When a repository contains no tracks, the CoverArt Display background
    returns to a default colour of white.
    The default colour of a "live" CoverArt Display is black but can now be
    changed with a preference option available from the preferences window.
    To be added to the new preference dialog shortly.
    To achieve this and keeps a proper reflection, the reflection shadow is
    added programmatically using a gdkpixbuf created from data.

    Fixes by Javier Kohen: "First, it escapes the mount point to allow
    white space in it. Second, it removes tags from the whole note
    contents so that links in the title don't end up in the file
    name. Last, but not least, colons are converted to hyphens, since
    the former are not valid characters in the FAT family of file
    systems, which the iPod uses."

    * src/display_spl.c:
    Renamed "Time" to "Track length" for better understanding.
    Fixed track length display (unit was seconds but msecs had to be
    entered. Furthermore, due to a bug in libgpod offline playlist
    generation assumed the track length was given in seconds whereas
    the live-update on the iPod assumed it was given in msecs. You
    need at least libgpod SVN version 1797 for this to work
    consistently. libgpod 0.6.0 does not contain the fix.
    
    src/display_photo.c:
    Squashed warning about pointer to integer conversion.

    stockid_init() is called from misc.c upon loading of application.
    This finds the correct paths of the specified icon images and loads
    pixbufs of them. These are then added to the default stock factory.
    Stock ids of these images can then be used throughout the application.
    
    * src/display_playlists.c
    
    Uses the new stock ids for the playlist icons.

    New ipods do not necessarily have ITDB_THUMB_PHOTO_LARGE or any
    other photo format so cannot assume these in display of thumbs in
    iconview or preview components.
    
    Fix is to find the first existing smalled thumb in the case of the
    iconview and biggest in the case of preview and scale the pixbufs
    to uniform sizes.
    
    Also, fix to clear the preview when a data change like remove occurs.

    * src/display_coverart.h: added DEFAULT_IMG_SIZE
    * src/display_coverart.c: improvements to image dimension setting
    algorithms for both x and y. Using ITDB_THUMB_COVER_LARGE for
    the preferred image means the coverart can be too big in the
    coverart display window. Thus, introduces a default maximum and
    algorithm to set it.

    * src/details.c: set tartwork_changed flag to TRUE rather than relying on
    using force_update_cover function. Former picked up by pm_track_changed()
    
    * src/display_coverart.c: coverart_track_change responds to track changes
    and redisplays covers if tartwork_changed flag has been set.
    
    * src/display_playlists.c: KEY_DISPLAY_COVERART pref test removed from
    pm_track_changed and placed inside coverart_track_changed instead.
    
    * file.c: update_track_from_file function updates calls for redisplay of the
    coverart regardless of any file data changes to ensure that any coverart
    changes do not go unnoticed.

    * src/details.c: tartwork_changed flag defined when a new
    artwork file is selected from the filesystem.
    
    * src/fetchcover.c: tartwork_changed flag added for all
    occurrences of artwork being changed.
    
    * src/display_coverart.c: reworking of the code to fix the
    sizes of the covers according to the ipod thumbnail size.
    When the pane is expanded, the coverart display's spacing
    is widened rather than the individual covers being
    stretched.
    Instead of the highlights, reflections and covers images
    being redrawn as black when null, the containing items
    are hidden. They are redisplayed when a new cover image
    is required.

    * display_itdb.h: added tartwork_changed flag to ExtraTrackData
    
    * details.c: initialise tartwork_changed flag to FALSE. Use this
    flag in details_copy_artwork as additional check if artwork
    has changed. Removal of all tilda related cruff.
    
    * fetchcover.c: removal of tilda related cruff with use of the
    tartwork_changed flag from ExtraTrackData. Set Prev Button
    initially to hidden until images from the net are retrieved.

    * src/display_playlists.c (pm_drag_motion): don't allow drops
    into non-loaded repositories. (pm_create_treeview): don't
    use GTK_DEFAULT_MOTION as this gives optical feedback that
    drops into the column header is allowed, even though it is
    not.
    
    * src/display_sorttabs.c (st_create_listview): renamed to
    st_create_treeview(), simplified and merged with parts of
    st_create_page which did part of creating the treeview. This
    is the point when I realize that DND into the sort tabs is
    not supported and I don't have to do anything. Code is
    easier to read and understand now.
    
    * src/display_tracks.c (tm_drag_motion): don't allow drops
    into non-loaded repositories.

    * src/misc_input.c: removed calls to dirbrowser_block() and
    dirbrowser_release() (obsolete because dirbrowser became
    modal)
    
    * src/fileselection.c
    src/fileselection.h
    data/gtkpod.glade: (adding of tracks, directories and
    playlist files): do not allow adding of tracks if no
    playlist is selected or if the iPod is not loaded into the
    selected repository. Better names for file chooser
    directories, dirbrowser modal, separate functions for glade
    callback.
    
    * src/file.c (copy_new_info): removed unused variables.
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@1588 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

    * src/mp3file.c:
    added reading/writing of tags for sort artist, sort album,
    sort title, sort albumartist and sort composer.
    
    * src/mp4file.c:
    
    Added reading/writing of the grouping tag, whatever that
    is.
    
    The sort tags are written by iTunes as fields of the
    iTunes_CDDB_IDs tag which I don't seem to be able to access
    (only the first field seems available without hacking). For
    reference: the field names are soar (artist), sonm (title),
    soal (album), soaa (album artist), soco (composer) and sosn
    (show).
    
    Added reading of coverart tag. Displayed by the iPod but not
    by the coverart display. Properly displayed in the details
    window.
    
    * src/file.c (copy_new_info): use switch() to avoid missing

    * details.c - details_copy_artwork
    Reintroduced if clause on whether to copy the artwork. If
    image file has been set by fetchcover then a tilde is appended
    to the filename. This method removes the tilde, renames the
    file and copies the artwork with the proper filename.
    
    * fetchcover.c
    Introduced flag USE_TILDA that is true when Details window calls
    fetchcover and false for when display coverart calls it. Tilda
    symbol added to end of filename if USE_TILDA set to true.
    Added references to dialog parents to properly control which
    windows can receive focus while dialogs are displayed.

    Bug fixes spotted by Daniele Forsi.
    
    Change in coverart not made to coverart display when apply button
    clicked on Details window.
    Fetchcover behaved awkwardly with naming the downloaded image files if
    the tracks concerned lacked album info in their ID3 tags.
    Coverart files from fetchcover subject to template values in the prefs.
    Should always be a default value of folder.jpg if none of the templates
    provide a non-null value.
    
    * details.c:
    details_copy_artwork() has to now always recopy the artwork
    from file. The reason being, fetchcover overwrites the artwork hence
    the file name will still be the same while different artwork.
    
    * display_coverart.h
    display_coverart.c:
    set_covers() and set_cover_item() now has a
    parameter to force an update of the cover images from file. Only used
    by details_copy_artwork() when the apply button is clicked on the
    details window.
    
    * fetchcover.c:
    dialog will now appear if a cover image file already exists in the
    tracks directory. Gives the options to overwrite, save as unique name
    or cancel completely.

    * display_coverart.c
    
    Added callback on display_coverart content panel for acting
    on scroll events with the mouse wheel. Result is that moving
    the scroll wheel while the mouse is over the coverart display
    will scroll the covers in the respective direction.
    
    Avoided possible null pointer in track_changed function.
    Thanks to Daniele Forsi for raising it. May need further work
    if this does not solve it.

    Changed the on_main_cover_image_clicked so that only the

    quicker and doesnt rely on the artist/album sorttabs
    being visible.

    * context_menus.c
    
    Fixed segfault in cad_context_menu_init() to avoid freeing
    tracks unnecessarily.
    
    * display_playlist.c
    
    Coverart display will only be updated with a track change,
    addition or deletion if it is visible and not minimized.
    
    * display_coverart.h
    display_coverart.c
    
    New Album_Item structure introduced for storage of tracks in
    coverart display. Replacement of displaytracks GList with a
    key list related to an Album_Item hashmap. Track_changed
    function changed to speed up changed, removal and addition
    operations. Other functions updated to reflect introduction of
    Album_Item and hashmap.

    Autodetection and auto-loading of iPods. This loads iPods
    automatically on start-up when they are connected or later
    when they are mounted. Uses gnome-vfs for detection of
    mounted volumes and HAL for determining if the mounted
    volume is an iPod. Works fine without HAL, and compiles fine
    without gnome-vfs, but without autodection facility.
    
    iPod repositories are added automatically when necessary and
    removed when ejecting an iPod. Preferences referring to an
    iPod are saved into the iTunes directory (gtkpod.prefs).
    
    
    gtkpod.glade
    src/prefs_windows.c:
    src/prefs.c
    - removed old auto-import functionality. Auto-import is no

    src/prefs.c

    * Consideration of extra scenario for removal of a track with
    respect to display of coverart. Basically, needed to cater
    for situation where user removes the first track in an album

    first track from displaytracks list but add in the second.

    2007-04-21 P.G. Richardson <phantom_sf at users.sourceforge.net>
    
    * Changed the way coverart display is updated when a track is
    removed, added and changed (Thanks to Jorg for thoughts on
    this. Much quicker response):
    ** display_coverart.h & display_coverart.c:
    - coverart_sort_images() made static
    - slider initialization broken out into own function
    - select_cover() will silently return rather than
    throwing an error if selected trk not found in display.
    - coverart_track_changed() added for deciding action to
    be taken when a track changes. Instead of expensive call
    to coverart_set_images()
    - coverart_set_images() extra parameter to stop recreation
    of display track list every time its called.
    ** display_playlists.c: pm_add_track, pm_remove_track,
    pm_track_changed all call coverart_track_changed
    ** display_sorttabs.c: resets coverart but only reloads all
    tracks if sort is set to none. No way to detect original
    sort order efficiently.
    ** misc_confirm.c: removal of coverart_set_image calls so pm
    functions relied on instead.

    * src/display_playlist.c (pm_drag_data_received): bugfix:
    allow to drop contents of one playlist into another playlist
    even if playlist view is "sorted". (Sorting currently
    disabled anyway)
    
    * src/display_playlist.c: small rework in preparation of
    future changes. New support functions
    pm_get_position_for_itdb(), pm_get_position_for_playlist(),
    pm_get_iter_for_itdb(), pm_get_iter_for_playlist() replace
    some of in-function code. pm_name_changed() changed to
    pm_itdb_name_changed().
    
    * src/file_itunesdb.c
    src/display_itdb.c: use of new support functions above
    instead of dedicated code.

    * src/file.c
    src/file_itunesdb.c
    src/misc_track.c: When podcasts were first introduced,
    iTunes did not add podcasts to the master playlist and only
    showed them in the Podcast playlist. This has changed in the
    meanwhile and Podcasts also appear in the master playlist
    (i.e. when browsing through the music files on an
    iPod). This patch make gtkpod behave the same. Old iTunesDBs
    with podcasts not listed in the MPL are automagically updated.

P.G. Richardson <phantom_sf@users.sourceforge.net>	2007-03-25

    * details.c:
    removal of coverart_set_images from details_button_apply_clicked()
    
    * display_coverart.c:
    set prefs key in coverart_init_display() when coverart display is displayed
    
    * display_playlists.c:
    added coverart_set_images to pm_add_track, pm_remove_track, pm_track_changed.
    retained coverart_set_images call in pn_selection_changed_cb as this displays the coverart when a playlist is selected
    
    * display_sorttabs.c:
    coverart_set_images retained in st_sort() as a reiniting of the coverart is never fired during an alphabetize operation
    
    * fileselection.c:
    calls to coverart_set_images removed as this is taken care of by pm_add_track() in display_playlists.c
    
    * delete_track_ok.c:
    call to coverart_set_images retained as although pm_remove_track correctly calls this function, it is too early in the delete process and the deleted track is still displayed
    
    * prefs.h:
    addition of KEY_DISPLAY_COVERART key for use by display_playlists functions

    * display_coverart.c: Changed coverart_set_images to internally
    get the playlist and checks whether the playlist is null
    or not. Thus, all calls to coverart_set_images require
    no checking of parameters beforehand.
    
    * details.c,
    display_playlists.c
    file_itunesdb.c
    fileselection.c
    misc_confirm.c: functions updated to call modified version of
				calls	coverart_set_images since this is used in too        coverart_set_images. data_changed function no longer    
    many other places where setting coverart is
    unnecessary and error prone.

    * display_coverart.c
    - Avoided null pointer exceptions by testing cdwidget first in coverart_block_change()
    - Ensured the pande0 button release event only initiaties if a width change has truly occurred
    ie. gtk_paned_get_position() != WIDTH
    
    * display_playlists.c
    - Blocked other coverart related changes while a pm_playlist_change_cb is being enacted.
    - Blocking is lifted prior to the call to coverart_set_images
    - pm_playlist_change_cb() will occur on deletion of a playlist. In this case the deleted playlist
    will be nullified. In this case, clear any coverart images rather than setting them (none to set)
    
    * file_itunesdb.c
    - data_changed function called whenever track details are changed. Added a resettting of the coverart
    to this function so all tracks in coverart display are synced with database data

    * src/display_itdb.c
    src/file_itunesdb.c: automatically sync playlists on
    startup (when loading database).
    
    * src/prefs_window.c: redefined the sync settings, set up
    easy-to extend handling for standard toggle checkboxes.
    
    * src/context_menu.c
    src/display.c: moved 'Sync' over to new 'Sync Playlist'.

    * src/file.c: copy_new_info() incorrectly handled pc_path and
    thumbnail_path, possibly leading to corruption of both when
    updating tracks.
    
    * src/repository.[ch]
    * src/syncdir.[ch]
    It's now possible to sync directories from within the
    repository option catalog. Next step: automatic sync at the
    time of loading the database. Almost there!

    gtkpod's repository seemed to have been affected by the hardware
    failure as not all files were up to date. This should put everything
    back.

    * src/syncdir.c:

    * file_itunesdb.c:

    added support for modification time of the song (needed for
    fast syncing)
    
    2006-05-08 Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>
    
    * moved path[i] and concal_autosync pref keys over to the
    new prefs system. Work in progress: currently the scripts
    for syncing cannot be set (this will be done from within
    the repository options).
    
    2006-05-08 Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>

    causing gtkpod to crash when exiting the preferences
    dialog (bug introduced on 9/13)

    Some hints for mounting gtkpod.
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@617 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2005-08-29

    * SAFETY: call sync() and flush all buffers to the iPod after
    writing the iTunesDB -- should minimise filesystem errors
    caused by people disconnecting the iPod without unmounting
    (four instances in itdb_itunesdb.c)
    
    * NEW: script to sync addressbooks in ldif format provided by
    Sebastien BERIDOT (scripts/sync-ldif.sh,
    scripts/ldif2vcf.sh).
    
    * NEW: script to sync kNotes (KDE note program) provided by
    Sebastian Scherer (scripts/sync-knotes.sh).
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@616 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2005-08-27

    * MP3 tags: use 'Band/Orchestra/Accompaniment' (TPE2) as
    artist if it exists. Otherwise use 'Lead artist/Lead
    performer/Soloist/Performing group' (TPE1) as before. Let
    me know if this causes problems for you.
    
    * BUGFIX: Copying playlists by drag and drop could confuse
    smart playlists referencing these playlists. This was due
    because the DND duplicated the ID by which these playlists
    were referenced. A new ID is now set automatically when
    adding playlists by itdb_playlist_add().

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2005-07-16

    * Improved handling of dangling files (files that are
    referenced in the iTunesDB but are not present on the iPod)
    after I had to use the function myself: iTunes 4.9 removed
    most of my files from the iPod -- currently restoring with
    an old iTunesDB copy.
    
    * Changed writing of iTunesDB to make sure OTG Playlists are
    handled correctly.
    
    * Fixed compatibility issue with new firmware 3.1 and iTunes
    4.9 (only 256 tracks were shown on the iPod, iTunes
    removed the majority of the tracks from the iPod).
    Podcasts are still not supported, however, and will be lost
    when handled by gtkpod.
    
    * Updated German translation catalog

    * itdb_itunesdb.c: fixed OTG playlist filename and handling
    (thanks to "Todd")
    
    * Makefile.am: use relative path for symbolic link to
    gtkpod.glade
    
    * misc.c: use 'eject' executable instead of eject code. Also
    fixes the bug that 'could not unmount' was always
    displayed, even if the umount was successful (thanks to
    Andreas Hauber).

    * Makefile.am: ln complained when installing the second time
    into the same place -- remove target file before the ln
    command.
    
    * itdb_itunesdb.c: changed from version 0x0c (iTunes 4.71/4.8)
    to version 0x0d (iTunes 4.9). mhods are now considered
    children of mhips, and the total length of the mhip must be
    adjusted accordingly.

    BUGFIX: Some iTunesDB written by iTunes could not be read
    because of an error in the parse code (gtkpod would attempt to
    read beyond the end of the file).

    ("The", "A",... at the beginning of fields). Prefs can be
    set, are stored and read, but they are not yet used. Also,
    the initial values must still be set.

    * bumped to version 0.94-CVS
    
    * update sort preferences window when clicking on track view
    headers
    
    NEW FEATURE: stable sorting of track view. This allows you, for
    example, to first sort by title, then by artist. The list will
    then be sorted by artist, but all titles of each artist remain
    sorted as well (before the tiles were random).
    Arbitrary depth and order of stable sorting is possible by
    clicking the sort columns in the desired order.

    BUGFIX: When changing the mountpoint, the change was not
    written to the preferences file correctly.
    
    BUGFIX: 'Copy from iPod' just failed in offline mode instead of
    giving meaningful error messages -> fixed.
    
    IMPROVEMENT: 'Copy from iPod' is not 'Export from Database' and
    allows to export from the local database as well. This is
    useful if you want to rename files in a consistant manner.
    
    Release as 0.93.1

    By Clinton Gormley (clint at traveljury dot com)
    
    1) Updated the each_rating_pl function as you suggested - this now works
    from the menu item
    2) The sync_evolution script that you sent me works fine
    3) Added a sync_evocalendar script which synchronises calendar and task
    from evolution
    4) Added a sync_notes script which puts anything in ~/ipod_notes (or a
    directory specified on the command line) into Notes
    5) Added a path for the notes_script under preferences
    6) Added options under Tools for Synchronise notes and Synchronise all
    (ie contacts, calendar and notes, with tooltip to that effect)
    7) If you tick the box specifying Do automatically when DB synced, also
    does notes now.

    Fixed "BROKEN_GTK_TREE_SORT": will print out error message when bug is present (<2.5.4), but will work fine even if compiled with <2.5.4 and later 2.5.4 is installed.

    New section in the README about ENVIRONMENT variables.
    
    IMPROVEMENT: Some fixes for compilation under solaris. This
    also led to the introduction of the environment variable
    "GTKPOD_DF_COMMAND" that can be used to customize the df
    command called to probe the free space of the iPod.

    BROKEN_GTK_TREE_SORT: unsort of treeviews will work with GTK 2.5.4 or above. The code needs some cleanup for GTK<2.5.4 -- at the moment it barely compiles...

    Flavio Stanchina: duplicate filename now supersides original filename

    BUGFIX: when clicking onto the column header of the track
    treeview three times and moving sidewards with the mouse at
    the same time, gtkpod crashed. Crashing was due to a bad
    workaround of a bug in the GTK+-library. Removed workaround
    and instead submitted a patch for GTK+. Until the patch has
    been accepted, unsorting will not work. The bug report is
    available at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152414
    and the patch can also be downloaded at
    gtkpod.sourceforge.net/gtkliststore_c.diff

    IMPROVEMENT: Moved some options from the preferences dialog to
    the file chooser dialog where you need them. gtkpod now
    requires GTK2.4 to compile.
    
    NEW FEATURE: export of PLS or M3U file including meta data.
    
    removed 2.0-2.4 patch file as it will no longer work.
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@424 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2004-08-14

    IMPROVEMENT: Speeded up writing of iTunesDB. For me it is now
    around one second instead of 38 seconds before (for security
    I'm using the iPod as a non-buffered device). A back-upped
    version of the iTunesDB is now always written to ~/.gtkpod.
    
    Fixed misleading error message "iTunesDB.ext does not exist"
    when actually iTunesDB does not exist (e.g. because the iPod
    is not mounted).
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@423 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

    Display soundcheck in dB
    
    Fixed localization Problem with replay gain values stored
    iTunesDB.ext
    
    Bounced version to 0.82-CVS (because of above localization
    problem).
    
    Context menus will not be displayed while display update is
    not finished (safer!).
    
    README: Added to "Update", "Playcounts", rewrote "Volume
    Normalization", and updated "Icons".
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@415 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2004-07-21

    BUGFIX: gain tags written by mp3gain were never read
    correctly. Normalization using mp3gain was therefore
    impossible. Didn't anyone ever use that feature?!
    
    Fixed a German translation.
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@413 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2004-07-19

    BUGFIX: fixed bug that caused gtkpod to hang when activating
    duplicate detection without having the list of duplicates
    displayed (must have been around ever since duplicate
    detection was introduced...)
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@412 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2004-07-19

    IMPROVEMENT: Added new track information fields: iPod_Path,
    creation time, soundcheck, samplerate, "BPM"
    
    IMPROVEMENT: Volume normalizing: when importing mp3 the replay
    gain is read and the soundcheck field set accordingly. Use
    the "soundcheck" feature of the iPod to have the volume
    normalized during playback.
    If no replay gain tag is set, use the "Normalize" as usual to
    have mp3gain write a replay gain tag.
    
    Added tooltips to describe the track colums (in prefs window
    and main application window -- not the obvious ones like
    "Artist", "Title" and the like).
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@411 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2004-07-18

    Changed version to 0.81-CVS
    
    Updated README (dangling and orphaned files)
    
    BUGFIX: handling of orphaned tracks that had been added to the
    ipod again are now handled correctly.
    
    BUGFIX: fixed case-sensitivity issue while handling orphaned
    tracks.
    
    IMPROVEMENT: Added "Created timestamp" support to special
    sorttab, track display and iTunesDB. (Before only "modified"
    and "played" were supported.)
    
    IMPROVEMENT: All information stored in the iTunesDB about
    tracks is read and written, even if the information itself is
    not used by gtkpod itself.
    
    IMPROVEMENT: Added new track information fields: iPod_Path,
    creation time
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@410 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2004-07-17

    Changed version to 0.80-2
    
    gtkpod V0.80-2
    BUGFIX: gtkpod would crash right after startup if the info
    window was open when stopping gtkpod the previous time.
    
    BUGFIX: Fixed free space display: the digits were right, the
    unit was wrong (B instead of kB, kB instead of MB, MB instead
    of GB...).
    
    PATCH: gtkpod will compile with GTK V2.0 (V0.80 needed GTK
    V2.4)
    
    PATCH: gtkpod should compile under Fedora without patch
    
    PATCH: reverted to old-style check of id3tag-lib as id3tag.pc
    is not included with the id3tag distribution by default
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@409 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

    Changed version to 0.80
    
    Moved id3tag detection to PKG_CHECK_MODULES() in configure.in
    
    Fixed scripts/Makefile.am to include the scripts into the distribution.

    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@404 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

    Applied Yaroslav Halchenko's patch for issues while exporting tracks
    to a vfat partition (leading and trailing spaces in filename).
    
    Optical work on status bar (height was fixed to 20 pixel...).
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@403 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2004-06-13

    Changed behaviour of free space update as it was somewhat incompatible
    with the automounter: the free space update would mount the iPod every
    five seconds...
    
    Now data from the disk is only read when you are working with gtkpod
    (e.g. adding tracks or clicking on playlists). This avoids that the
    iPod gets mounted while you are attempting to disconnect it. Also,
    readint the disk data is done in a background job as accessing the
    drive with the automounter could take more than 100 ms.

    With support from  Armando Atienza started a way to register that
    tracks have been played externally (by xmms etc).
    
    There will be a plugin (acutally the code is already here) that will
    call "gtkpod -p <filename>" after a track has been played.
    
    gtkpod will then contact a running instance of gtkpod and report that
    filename via a UNIX socket (/tmp/gtkpod-<username>, comments welcome:
    better use a pipe?). The running instance of gtkpod will increase the
    playcount of that file by one. If the file is not in the database, it
    is registered in ~/.gtkpod/offline_playcount.
    
    If no running instance of gtkpod exists, the file is registered in
    ~/.gtkpod/offline_playcount.
    
    TODO:
    
    - After the import of the itunesDB the offline_playcount file must be
    parsed.
    
    - Write function get_track_by_ipod_filename() that finds a file in the
    database if it is located on the iPod (as opposed to on the local
    filesystem).
    
    Most of the code is in clientserver.c.
    
    Comments welcome.

    Fixed an error in itunesdb.c that prevented the iPod from accessing
    freshly added tracks (introduced with the case-fix patch about a week
    ago). The tracks were copied to the iPod but no ":" was added at the
    beginning of the iPod path -> iPod could not find the files. Fixed.
    
    Affected users have to remove the affected tracks and add them
    again. I won't add an automatic fix -- this is the danger of using
    "cutting edge" CVS code.

    TODO:

    Bugfix in itunesdb.c (thanks to Christophe Fergeau)
    
    Changed u_int16_t... to guint16... in mp4file.c

    problems because of missing mp4.h).
    
    IMPROVEMENT: streamlined layout of info window
    
    NEW FEATURE: added support for WAV audio files
    
    Added %Y to export filename and filename-parse-template (year).
    
    Added support for multiple templates when parsing the filename for
    tags (separate them with a ';')
    
    IMPROVEMENT: can specify several templates for the export
    filename. gtkpod selects according to the extension given.
    
    IMPROVEMENT: send 'eject' to the iPod after unmounting. This only
    works if the user has write access to the device file

    Changed format options for 'filename_format' for export of files from
    the iPod to be identical to the ones used for parsing the filename for
    tags. Old format will be converted on the fly when reading the prefs.
    
    Added some format options for 'filename_format'.
    
    Cosmetic changes to configure.in.
    
    New section in README about parsing filename for tags and unicoded
    ID3V2 tags.
    
    Added some comments to parse_filename() (this function still needs
    decent error handling...).
    
    Updated de.po.
    
    Bumped version to 0.72-CVS.

    Preliminary finish of the info window.
    
    Moved statusbar stuff from misc.c to info.c

    IMPROVEMENT: Track number and total number of tracks is displayed
    as nn/nn in the track view, and can also be entered as such.
    
    IMPROVEMENT: The tags for CD number and total number of CDs can
    now be displayed (analoguous to track number and total number of
    tracks above)
    
    IMPROVEMENT: In the past, using programs other than gtkpod to
    transfer files voided the extended information file. gtkpod will
    not try to use the MD5 checksums stored in the extended
    information file to match up the data when this occurs.
    
    git-svn-id: https://gtkpod.svn.sf.net/svnroot/gtkpod/gtkpod/trunk@304 f01d2545-417e-4e96-918e-98f8d0dbbcb6

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2003-11-14

    Actually, this was in the last import
    
    IMPROVEMENT: When adding existing tracks:
    Until now the default action when adding tracks that already
    exist (identical full filename) was to add it again (they were
    refused by the duplicate detection, but that took a long time),
    or to update the track information (option).
    
    Now the default action is to skip existing tracks (identical
    filename) or to update the track information (option). Thus, by
    default, only new tracks are read, allowing quick synchronization
    of entire directories.
    
    This is new:
    
    IMPROVEMENT: When creating a new playlist a dialog is popped up
    asking for a name.
    
    BUGFIX: "Unsort" (clicking sort column three times) of track
    view failed if last sort tab was a "special" sort tab.
    
    IMPROVEMENT: Year is now supported as track view column and as
    sort tab type.

    itunesdb.c: when creating filename for iPod, use the suffix (.mp3,
    .m4p...) from the original PC file.
    
    mp4file.c: .m4a (and maybe .m4p) can now be copied onto the
    iPod. Don't try to change the TAGS in gtkpod yet...
    
    I'm currently listening to the worldwide-first .m4a file transferred
    to the iPod by a linux utility (as far as I know, anyway). Too bad,
    it's not really my taste ;-)

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2003-11-03

    Started implementation of aac format (.m4a and .m4p files).
    
    I'm planning to use the m4pv2 library (mpeg4ip.sf.net) for reading and
    writing mp4 tags. If the m4pv2 library is not available, custom code
    (almost finished) will be added for reading mp4 tags, but not for
    writing.
    
    Have a look at the console ouput when adding .m4a or .m4p files. Also,
    please check if adding/updating of mp3 files still works. I had to
    change the handling quite a bit to allow easy adding of further
    formats. The same restructuring will have to be done for tag writing.
    
    New files: mp4file.[ch]

    Sam -- I've changed the id3_tag_write() function in the way I thought
    it should work with local charsets. It's writing, but it's not
    overwriting the old tag. Instead it adds "TAG...." at the end of the
    file, even though I've changed "TIT2". Any ideas?

    * rewrite of id3 functions to use libid3tag rather then libid3.
    The result is much cleaner and simpler and removes the dependancy
    on libstdc++.
    
    There might be a few bugs with charsets in here but I think I got
    most of them.  Certainly the code is very simple and any bugs should
    be easily fixable.
    
    On debian libid3tag ships with a pkg-config file so this is how
    I detect it in configure.in.  If other dists have trouble with this
    we can fall back to traditional autoconf methods.

    Included patch from Chris Cutler for creation of a playlist for each
    genre. Needs some more work (not only genre, but also artist etc.,
    confirmation dialogue, move menu entry from "File" to "Edit"...) which
    should be under way.

    added date_parser2.l which was not easy because automake does not
    "really" support multiple lexers. I worked around it by
    
    1) requiring "flex" -- it will not work with "lex"
    2) defining
    %option prefix= (...)
    %option outfile="lex.yy.c"
    3) hard-coding "LEX_OUTPUT_ROOT = lex.yy" in Makefile.am
    
    date_parser2 will try to determine which kind of string we have, e.g.
    <date1
    date1 < d < date2
    ...
    
    It should then break down the string into the date token and pass it
    to the other date_parser. This is not done yet. (The original
    date_parser is called with the entire string, so expect some error
    messages).

    No functionality change, just compiler cleanups.
    
    Gcc 3.2 doesn't like extra tokens at the end of #endif's
    Also add missing includes to hush compiler warnings.

    itunesdb.c, file_export.c:

    fixed memory holes in pm_data_compare_func(),

    made provisions for case-(in)sensitive sorting -- but
    g_utf8_collate always seems to be case-insensitive (in de_DE
    locale) :-?

    in the iTunesDB, though).
    
    star rating and play counts is not yet stored in the iTunesDB -- need

    - Implemented "Sync Dir": normal menu and context menu
    
    - Tweaked free space display:
    
    - free space = space left on iPod +
    space taken by songs marked for deletion -
    size of non-transferred songs
    
    - 1 kB = 1000 Bytes
    - 1 MB = 1.000.000 Bytes
    ...
    - added TB = 10**12 Bytes (for future iPods :-)

    charset.c

    added a gtkpod_warning() popup window (instead of having a macro print
    onto the console). We should go through the code to make sure
    gtkpod_warning() is used consistently instead of printf.
    
    Good night,

    Gtkpod now displays the amount of free space your ipod has.
    
    This also reverts the music directory code to use only FXX not fXX if
    FXX does not exist.  Jorg will you look through to see if I revereted it
    right?
    
    I just tested all of this off of a fresh ipod and it seems to be working
    wonderfully.
    
    I'm gonna bump the version, and fix the readme to add the shortname
    stuff to your /etc/fstab if you have problems.

    Weird weird weird.  Apparently the submenu(Alphabetize) menu items
    weren't accepting button release events.  However they worked if you
    used button 3, but since we want button1 to activate the menu item we
    work around it by adding button release events to the menu item
    manually.
    
    In the process of chasing this down I found out that gtk_menu_popup
    should be called with button parameter of 0 if it's initiated from a
    button release event(like we're currently doing).  This is also fixed.

    - added "Tools" Menu with "Play" and "Enqueue"
    - changed callback/menu names of some menu entries to be more
    consistent.
    
    context_menus.[ch], misc.[ch]:
    - moved play functions to misc.c (play_songs (), enqueue_songs ())

    Fix waitpid parameters so the scripts/mounts finish before we return to the
    parent process.  It was taking WNOHANG | WUNTRACED now it's taking 0
    According to the man page
    The value of options is an OR of zero or more of the following constants:
    
    WNOHANG - which means to return immediately if no child has exited.
    
    WUNTRACED - which means to also return for children which are stopped, and
    whose status has not been reported.
    
    So loading spb2 from gtkpod.in and using the prefs to automount your ipod
    would fail as well as autoimport.

    Guess I just needed something to code to calm down and relax:
    
    - callbacks.s: "Export Songs" now with the usual submenus
    "Playlist", "Entry", and "Songs"
    - context_menus.c: replaced HOOKUP macro with function (for some
    reason I don't like macros so much...)
    - renamed get_currently_selected_playlist/songs to
    pm/sm_get_selected_playlist/ongs
    
    BTW -- among the recently added features I enjoy the context menus
    most!

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2003-03-18

    - corrected "xmms xmms..." in prefs and context-menus
    - added tooltip for mount-stuff
    - added description in prefs.c on how to add prefs-item.
    - misc.c: have the parent wait4() the child process to finish
    (mount/umount)
    - misc.c: added code to execute ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.in,out or
    /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.in,out
    - prefs.c: added code to read /etc/gtkpod/prefs

    Feature request from Matt Adam <matt@phlegmatic.ca> to mount/unmount ipod on
    startup/shutdown.
    
    Is there a way to get my module to autodetect my iPod(showing up as
    /dev/sdX) just by plugging it in, and let me unplug it whenever I want(as
    long as it's not mounted)  This new feature would be ultra cool if i could
    do that.  Jorg?
    
    There is a prefs option, etc etc.  we should document what functions need to
    be modified in order to add new prefs as it's getting quite large.

    context_menus.c:
    - moved which() to a more appropriate place...
    - fixed memory hole: get_currently_selected_songs() creates a new
    list of songs that was never freed. Now a new list is created in
    every case (also for pm/st context menus) that is freed the next
    time a context menu is opened.
    - was there a reason to exclude the MPL from context menu actions?

Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs@users.sourceforge.net>	2003-03-16

    Added path entries in the prefs dialogue for "Enqueue" and "Play
    Song".
    
    Changed the play_song() to do_command_on_entries(): accepts any
    @command to be called with command line args. Only one call is made
    for the entire list of songs. Also, if "%s" is present in @command,
    the list of songs is inserted at that position.

    I'm currently implementing the "Play Song" command line in the prefs...
    
    display.c:
    - fixed memory leak in pmsm_list_store_move_after
    - don't allow to drag master playlist to a different position
    
    gtkpod.glade:
    - changed layout of prefs_window slightly
    
    prefs_window.c:
    - "Select Entry 'All' in Sort Tab...": only sort tabs visible can be
    selected.

    display.[ch]...: removed SM_COLUMN_NONE (not necessary any more)
    
    display.c: fixed sorting of playlists/sort tabs: mpl/"All" stays on
    top.
    
    callbacks.c, display.c: "fixed" or re-established DND for playlists
    
    DND changes of song/playlist order are saved automatically. Changes
    due to sorting have to be acknowledged (menu item "Save Song Order"),
    unless the corresponding option is set in the prefs.
    
    IMPROVEMENT: add_songs and add_files will now add directly into the
    currently selected playlist. add_playlist will still create a new
    playlist with the name of the playlist file.

    Right click menus for songs and playlists.  Should be relatively easy to
    hook these same menus into the sort tabs.  most everything is wrapped into
    context_menu.[ch] and uses subsystems provided by other parts of gtkpod, so
    the code is pretty small.  Yum =)
    
    Added a new pref attribute whcih is the path to xmms, need to add a prefs
    window entry for it, but that will come later.

    - re-ordering of songs in song view
    - DND from file manager into song view

    - new prefs settings (show_duplicates, -updated, -non_updated)
    - cleared problem with persistent sorting in song view (will be
    "reset" after changing selection in sort tab or playlist view
    - new prefs setting: save order after resort automatically or use menu
    item for "snapshot"
    - added/changed code for snapshot (sm_rows_reordered_callback) and
    to adopt the playlist song order in the sort tabs
    (st_adopt_song_order)
    - song view columns are draggable now. Order is saved.

    IMPROVEMENT: speed-up of display refreshs.
    - Import of iTunesDB with full non-blocked display: 4x as fast (51''
    against 3'35'' on my 2459 songs)
    - Refresh of first sort tab, non-blocked: 20x as fast (0.65''
    against 13'' on my 2459 songs)
    - Refresh of first sort tab, blocked: 60x as fast (0.13''
    against 7.8'' on my 2459 songs)
    - Refresh of song list, non-blocked: 2x as fast (9'' against 18''
    on my 2459 songs)
    
    I'm now using a hash table for the sort tab entries (as suggested by
    Corey), and I switched from fixed counts between two screen refreshs
    to variable counts that are adjusted on-the-fly to yield a screen
    refresh every REFRESH_MS milliseconds. REFRESH_MS is currently 200 ms.

    add_song() returns a pointer to the song (which may be different

    Improvement: you can select a new playlist / sort tab item / sort tab
    page any time now -- even when the display is currently updated.
    
    Problem: somehow the button_release events get lost if you don't
    select "block display during udpates". This has as consequence that
    the GTKTreeViews think you are about to drag the selected item. I
    don't know yet why that happens...

    automatically". This is good for reinits.
    
    #if 0'ed code to capture song sorting (removed some songs from
    playlist)
    
    removed code to "recategorize" song after tags have been
    changed via the sort tab (incomplete, inconsistent, not what
    you want)
    
    Rewrote st_add_song code -- now the display can be refreshed
    while adding songs and gtkpod doesn't look like it had
    died. (Implemented for adding songs and adding dirs and
    
    Changed default behaviour: Entry "All" will be selected again
    if it was selected before -- no matter what
    "prefs_get_st_autoselection ()" says. However, it is also
    possible to unselect entries (ctrl-mouse). Then "All" will
    only be selected automatically if prefs_get_st_autoselection
    allows us to.
    
    gtkpod.glade:
    removed the accelerator ctrl-a for "select_all" because it
    caused a run-time error with gtk2.2.0. ctl-a still works,
    though.

    song.c
    
    After import of itunesDB, all songs are given consecutive ipod
    ID numbers. This avoids problems (running out of free IDs and
    reusing used ones) if some "funny guy" puts "ID=-1" somewhere
    into the database.
    
    id3_tag.c
    
    BUGFIX: Added code to write track tag
    
    BUGFIX: Looking at the code, it appears that all tags not
    except the changed one got deleted when the option "Write all
    tags" was not activated. I don't know why this "feature"
    didn't work, but I made sure it also will not work in the
    future.
    
    callbacks.c

    song.c
    Bugfix: Kentaro Fukuchi pointed out that MusicMatch (at least the
    Japanese version) distributes song IDs starting with 2 (and not
    with 53). Fixed. If some other program start with 1 (reasonable),
    please let me know.
    
    Bugfix: add_song() don't change ipod_id if one is already
    given in the passed song struct
    
    Improvement: threaded removal and copy of songs, so the
    display doesn't freeze on long file system operations
    
    Improvement: export can be interrupted and be continued at a later
    time. gtkpod will (hopefully) correctly remember which songs have
    already been copied/deleted from your iPod.
    
    misc.c
    Improvement: better handling of statusbar timeout

    song.c:
    changed some messages.
    
    added function to clear out md5_hash values from all songs
    
    extended hash_songs(): when hashing is switched on after songs
    have already been added, duplicate songs will be detected and
    be removed. Playlists are preserved, because when removing a
    duplicate song from a playlist, we add the original song back
    to the playlist.
    
    added function void remove_duplicate (Song *oldsong, Song
    *song) that can be used for duplicate removal. Can be made to
    pop up a window.
    
    playlist.c:
    fixed bug: don't add NULL-song to playlist.
    
    added gboolean song_is_in_playlist (Playlist *plitem, Song *song);
    
    playlist.[ch]:
    remove_song[id]_from_playlist() will now return TRUE/FALSE
    depending on whether song was actually a member
    
    misc.[ch]:
    added gchar *get_song_info (Song *song) to retrieve some human
    readable information from "song"
    
    before quitting gtkpod, a requester is popped up (if appropriate)
    
    md5.[ch]:
    md5_song_exists() will now return pointer to existing
    duplicate.
    
    renamed u_char to u_int8_t
    
    confirmation.[ch]:
    added possibility to hide buttons. Apply button is now also
    available.
    
    misc.c:
    changed calls to gtkpod_confirmation() (because of apply
    button)
    
    parse_ipod_id_from_string() can now handle arbitrarily long
    strings.
    
    display.c:
    fixed bug in st_song_changed(): could segfault if no entry was
    selected.
    
    fixed strange messages when window got closed by windowmanager
    instead of Ctrl-Q.
    
    drag-and-drop: number of songs to drag can be arbitrarily
    large now.
    
    dirbrowser.c, misc.c:
    added code to get nicer display of duplicate songs.
    
    configure.in:

    md5.[ch], song.[ch]:
    moved void md5_unique_file_init(GList *songlist) to
    hash_songs(). hash_songs() will allow window refreshs during
    hashing.
    
    callbacks.c, prefs.c:
    moved handling of md5 hash to prefs_set_md5song();
    
    misc.c:
    statusbar: remove old timeout function before adding new one
    
    song.c, playlist.c
    more update messages during import / hashing.

    Summary: Threw out threads, put in gtk updates during import etc.
    
    I'm using "block_widgets()" and "release_widgets()" to make sure no
    harmful user input is done during operation. I don't know how to block
    keystrokes, however, so I'm checking the global variable
    "widgets_blocked" in callbacks.c to block them.
    
    
    itunesdb.c:
    renamed all function calls to the in-memory database from
    add_... to it_add_... and from get_... to it_get_... so we can
    add hooks where necessary.
    
    song.h, playlist.h:
    defined most of the it_add_... to the original meaning without
    "it_"
    
    song.c, playlist.c:
    added remaining it_ functions.
    
    prefs.[ch]:
    timeout for statusbar messages can be set with
    prefs_set_statusbar_timeout()
    
    display.[ch], song.[ch]: added code for "background" exporting,
    importing, adding of files and directories. md5 reading is not yet
    done.

    ST_... (defined in display.h) to S_... (defined in song.h)
    
    display.[ch]:
    renamed SM_COLUMN_TRACK to SM_COLUMN_TRACK_NR to be
    consistent
    
    display.c, song.[ch]:
    added code to allow to only write selected ID3 tags
    
    prefs.[ch], prefs_window.[ch]:
    added option to let the user choose if he wants all ID3 tags
    updated or just the one (S)HE just changed.
    
    configure.in:
    added language "ja"
    
    po/
    added translation catalogue for Japanese (ja.po)

    more sane default behavior.  Only set the title for songs with no readable
    id3s, this way you can use the sort tabs to rename all the files at once,
    and then the album attribute.

    Here are threaded reads/writes/md5ing/id3 modifying
    
    Weirdnesses about it.  If you take the gtkpod_statusbar_message out of the
    comments a weird A appears in your terminal and the app freezes.  I think
    this has something to do with the main widget being set to not sensitive at
    the time the status bar message request is made.  I tried fixing it with a
    timer, but it's not really reliable.  Would it be ok to have return codes
    for the functions handle_import() and handle_export()
    I think this problem could be avoided that way.

    DND for user defined playlists allows the user to take control of lists
    again that have already been sorted.  We only get up to date lists when the
    user drags, not by simply clicking the sort tabs.
    
    DND reordering does not work for the master playlist.
    
    What should we do about SM_COLUM_IPOD, SM_COLUMN_PC_PATH,
    SM_COLUMN_TRANSFERRED.  Should we leave them in for debugging purposes,
    #if 0 them out,  or nuke them completely?  I went ahead and re-enabled
    these 3 columns again, but they're not visible.

    Enable song reordering and alert our internal datastructures of the new
    order.
    
    This works fine if you haven't sorted on a column yet.  There seems to be no
    way to put it back to "no ordering"
    
    gtk_tree_model_sort_reset_default_sort_func doesn't seem to want ot work
    with our song model, but once we figure out how to turn song sorting "off"
    and let the user interact with it this will be complete and what's written
    to the db will be consistent with what you see on screen.
    
    We also need a way to alert our internal data structures when the column
    sort buttons are pressed.  Any ideas?
    
    Hushed two warnings in display.c also.

    prefs.c:
    removed the adding of "/" at the end of the browse dir -- I
    ended up with more than five of them in my prefs.
    
    using g_memdup() to duplicate (most) of the config structure
    in clone_prefs()
    
    gtkpod.glade, prefs.[ch], prefs_window.[ch], display.c, callbacks.[ch]:
    added code for "sort tab autoselection" option
    
    dirbrowser.c:
    fixed bug in the original dirbrowser.c code that caused the
    specified directory not to be selected if the specified
    directory ended in "/" (instead the root directory was
    selected).
    
    display.c:

    added:
    
    Due to a caching problem with glib2's g_get_charset()
    function, changing the locale after g_get_charset() has
    already been called, will not affect the glib's conversion
    routines (they will use the cached charset instead).
    
    As a consequence, changing the locale in the prefs window
    after a file selection or directory selection dialog has been
    opened, has no effect. This problem has been resolved with
    version 2.1.5 of glib2.

    already existing duplicate song.
    
    doubled blocksize for hash (ran into duplicates that weren't)

    song.c:
    added code for writing extended info (in separate file
    "iTunesDB.ext", for keeping backups, and for working
    offline, i.e. without iPod connected. If you work offline,
    all changes are written to iTunesDB and iTunesDB.ext in
    ~/.gtkpod on export. You need to go "online" and export to
    transfer files to the iPod.
    
    added code to set unset tags using the filename. This code
    (set_entry_from_filename()) is called from
    add_filename_by_name() and should be improved to use a user
    specified format to extract the information from the filename.

    itunesdb.[ch]:
    Introduced itunesdb_write_to_file (): like itunesdb_write, but
    you can specify the filename directly, rather than the mount
    path of the iPod.
    
    Replaced the "/*" spitting compiler warnings.
    
    prefs.[ch]:
    Changed read/write_prefs() to use concat_dir() instead of
    snprintf() to concat path and dir (you never quite know if the
    path ends with "/").
    
    Changed read_prefs() to be easier to extend (still don't know
    what prefs_readline() actually was doing...).
    
    Added cfg-entries for "offline", "write extended infos",
    "keep_backups"
    
    prefs_window.[ch]:
    Added cfg-entries for, "write extended infos", "keep_backups"
    
    gtkpod.glade:
    Added Options for "write extended infos" and "keep backups" in
    prefs window, added new menu item for "offline"
    
    main.c:
    "GtkWidget *gtkpod" is passed to read_prefs ();

    display.[ch]:
    fixed bug in pm_remove_playlist():
    don't select playlist if there's none left
    improved pm_remove_playlist():
    select next playlist or previous playlist (instead of first one)
    selection of playlist can be switched off (speed up program exit)
    fixed bug in sort tab handling: if the main window is closed with
    the window close symbol, gtk seems to select pages in the
    notebooks. Since the data in sorttab[] has already been deleted,
    this caused the program to crash. This is now taken care of in
    st_get_instance() and st_page_selected().
    misc.c:
    fixed bug in gtkpod_main_quit(): first delete playlists, then
    songs (otherwise the display might access non-existing song
    entries).
    itunesdb.[ch]:
    moved code to copy a file to cp() which can be used by other
    functions.

    Changes - You can free up space on your ipod now by deleting songs from the
    master playlist. I somehow broke playlist writes, and it's really
    inconsistent, needs some more looking at.
    
    File Modification:
    
    configure.in - version bump, file deletion from your ipod should work
    
    display.c -
    * made the playlist model select a sensible "next" when a playlist
    is deleted from the model.
    * don't allow renaming of the main playlist
    
    itunesdb.c -
    * added a variable to allow for read/write debugging.  it's either
    "REALLY verbose or none at all, set ITUNESDB_DEBUG to 1 to get output
    * change the copy_song_to_ipod function to randomly choose a directory
    to write to.  this is better because it's random and should be evenly
    distributing it ? Saw it as a todo and did it.
    main.c -
    * seed the random number generator on start with time(NULL)
    * remove some of the cleanup code after gtk_main_quit to consolidate
    cleaning into gtkpod_main_quit
    misc.c -
    * added gtkpod_main_quit to clean up all the data structures on exit.
    * I'm getting weird errors on exit, as far as I can tell the code isn't
    doing what i'm coding. if you notice any difference between quiting
    with ctrl-q and clicking the "close" button in your wm, please let me
    know.
    misc.h -
    * added gtkpod_main_quit to the header
    playlist.c -
    * fixed remove_song_from_playlist so it handles file deletions from the
    ipod too.
    prefs.c -
    * cfg_new - more sane defaults asks permission before deleting anything
    song.c -
    * added a free_song function just to clean up the file structure.  It
    seems like we might benefit from breaking up the concept of a song and
    the way we manage it in gtkpod...
    * fixed add_song so it can handle registering songs passed to it by the
    itunes db during parsing.  a bug i introduced =(
    * added remove_song_from_ipod_by_id it appens itself to a static
    "pending deletion" list in song.c  This means we don't delete anything
    unless we tell the ipod to export, so you can exit without saving and
    not commit to changes you made.
    * modified flush_songs - so it deletes all the files that are pending
    deletion before it copies them to the disk.  a little bit of math and
    we could relay the disk usage to the user via the status bar
    song.h
    * added free_song to the header
    * added remove_song_from_ipod_by_id to the header

    subsystem to export files from your ipod to an arbitrary directory on disk.
    
/home/me/        requires the base directory i.e.     
    requires the directory name you want i.e.  "DJ_Sets"
    (would make sure /home/me/DJ_Sets/ exists)
    and GList with node data of type Song*  to export to the disk.
    
    there is an associated pref, and for now select the files you want and
    export to disk via the Edit menu.

    hook in the file deleting stuff.
    
    Set scrollbars on the about window to be policy automatic
    
    Add delete_window.[ch] to Makefile.am
    
    Add callbacks for keyinput(the only way to delete currently)
    
    Untility functions added to display.c
    
    get_currently_selected_playlist()
    get_currently_selected_songs()
    
    both retrieve which row/rows are selected in gtkpod and return either the
    Playlist* that's selected or a GList of Song* that is selected
    
    Update prefs to manage smart fiel deletion

    The beginnings of a file/playlist deletion mechanism.  Hooks into prefs,
    won't ask your more than once if you think you're really smart.  Frontend is
    there and it's identifying what needs to be removed, need sleep first...
    
    Options still need to be hacked into the prefs window to change, for now
    hack your text file to revert.

    * Removed unusable "Year" song attribute from callbacks,interface,prefs, and
    prefs_window
    * Fixed Column ordering in display.c
    * Added Track Number column to song display, you can sort by and edit track
    numbers now
    * Added default cases to switch statements containing none in display.c
    * Added function sm_show_preferred_columns function, it displays the columns
    requested by the current preference settings
    * Prefs are now read from a file(~/.gtkpod/prefs) when gtkpod loads.  Upon
    any successful save of the preferences(i.e. OK clicked in prefs_window)
    current settings are saved.  Preferences are also rewritten at quit
    time.
    
    Parsing text files sucks.
    We need some more people testing this than just me !!!

    more preferences work yum yum yum
    
    * preferences now read your $IPOD_MOUNTPOINT env variable defaults to /mnt
    * can now select which attributes you want displayed in the song list.
    - display.[ch] needs a function to reselection columns.
    - we still need to write preferences on exit...

    Added support for md5ing files and identifying duplicate copy attempts
    NOTE:
    * This uses SHA1 and you need the openssl development libraries to
    compile it, however for running it shouldn't require anything we don't
    already have on our systems(ssh?).  If using the Openssl libs isn't ok
    it's abstracted enough that it continues to interact fine with gtkpod
    and we change its internal representation.
    * Let me know if you get any incorrect collisions.
    * Yes it's slower to load up the first time(takes about 10 seconds for 4
    gigs of music on my g3 500mhz ibook) , but there is no noticeable
    difference after the database has loaded to do the lookup.
    * It is an option and has an associated attribute in prefs.[ch]
    
    changes in song.c
    * add_song now returns gboolean.  If md5 checksumming is enabled it will
    not allow the user to add a duplicate
    * get_song_name_on_disk.  New function to identify the filename on disk.
    
    New Args:
/* do md5 checksumming on files. */        -c     
    --md5	/* same as -c */
